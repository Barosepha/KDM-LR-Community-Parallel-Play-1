4 Survivors. No rerolls. No lifelines. The survivors are strong, the gear is good. I think we need to go hard, go all in and pray. Level 3 Flower Knight, the payout will be huge, the showdown will be dangerous. We'll win.


||LY 11 Flower Knight Lvl 3 Hunt||

(minor retcon here, I've been convinced that putting noodling on the first space of the hunt is usually correct and will be doing that for my own benefit in this case. Moderate cheat, but c'est la vie lol)

Noodling of Death: Blueborn Rolls, 10 into the depths, 2 to lose 3 survival and 3 insanity. All good, it wasn't even in my benefit anyway lol.


Blueborn Basic: 31, Strange Path. Blueborn is insane and we must follow the path. They have 9 understanding so we are guaranteed the 10+ result. We skip the remainder of the hunt and immediately ambush the monster. I mean... The fight will be incredibly, incredibly favored for us because of this. But also, we've missed another year of opportunity for Copper and the Elastomer Mines. Very annoying, but I'm happy it happened.

Alright, uneventful hunt phase but so it goes! Into a presumably very eventful showdown!
