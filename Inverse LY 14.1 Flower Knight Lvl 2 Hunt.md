||LY 14 Flower Knight Lvl 2 Hunt||


As of last year, we shuffled in 'Dead Warrior' to our hunt event deck. How neat!

Special Hunt Event - Noodling of Death: 4, random vermin. Golden Frog. Apt.

Rose Random HE: 47, Hungry Ground. Rose rolls with +4 thanks to beegoo's Whip: 8. Nothing happens.

Misfortune random HE: 73, Golden Ember. Yikes. Think we'll pass and roll an extra

Mulligan: 68, Familiar Face. Reset to 0 insanity, gain 1 understanding, trigger Insight and gain Explore, 3 survival, and 3 insanity.

Thorn random HE: 70, Tomb of Excellence. Thorn Investigates, benefitting from their new Explore ability! 

They roll 12, giving everyone 1 Understanding and also allowing us to place the Flower Knight's Trap at the bottom of the deck this showdown. That's great info! Should make this showdown extremely simple.


beegoo random HE: Dead Warrior! We send thorn to Investigate, guaranteeing the good result. They gain Black Guard Style and we get a Skull. I'll give Rose the insanity.


The Forest Wants What it Wants: 4 :/ We can work with it, maybe. We'll give everyone -1 str token, everyone but Misfortune 1 Bleed, and make beegoo gain a Disorder (that they ignore with Almanac) to bring us up to 12. Then I guess I'll give Misfortune the last bleed since they'd gain it anyway from the result we'd be getting if I didn't. Everyone gains 1 understanding and 1 insanity.


Special Hunt Event- Mineral Gathering: Rose and Thorn both have picks

Rose: 8

Thorn: 10

2 broken lanterns, and we get to delve into the tunnels! We'll sent beegoo in first since they have every available bonus.

beegoo: 9. We'll spend 2 survival to delve deeper > 6. We get an Iron. Fair play!

Thorn: 9. We'll take the Iron here.

Misfortune: 2. They gain Aichmophobia. No problem for a F&T prof builder about to retire!

Rose: 7. -2 survival +2 insanity.


Special Hunt Event- Herb Gathering:

beegoo: 8, 7, 8. 0 total.

Thorn: 8, 3, 9. 20.

Misfortune: 5, 5, 6. Christ, 0.

Rose: 6, 7, 2. 15! Thank goodness.

Our total thanks to the OD bonus is EXACTLY 45!!! We get a total of 4 survival from the event, 2 Fresh Acanthus, and a Vermin. Lonely ant. Sure! That could be helpful at some point.


Rose FK HE- Wooly Root. Rose rolls a 9, taking 3 brain damage, +eva token and -1 acc token. Lovely!


Special Hunt Event - Red Incursion. Please God: 1. Nononononono. Thorn will use their Lifetime Reroll.

Mulligan: 10! We delve into the mines. Awesome :) Additionally, everyone other than Misfortune gains 3 insanity and survival thanks to our Storytelling innovation.

Corpse Pit: 8. Red thread, no bleed, 1 understanding, and our choice of depth. I think we'll go to the Fossilized Nest to make sure we don't accidentally put ourselves in danger by highrolling too hard here.

Fossilized Nest: 10. Lmao, this is what I was talking about. If I rolled this here I'd only have 2 resin and have to choose whether or not I was willing to get myself killed in the Heartwyrm Tunnels.

Grimy Refinery: 5, Collapsed Lung, 1 resin, and another roll. 1, reroll +3. 4, same as 5 from before. 9, 2 resin and a choice. Here's the over/under. 50% of the time, we  get a TON of resin and some extra Iron. 50% of the time we get a die 60% of the time, and the other 40% of the time we get a TON of resin 70% total odds of 6 resin, 30% odds of death. If this were someone else important and not 1 pip away from F&T mastery, I might do it, but I won't today. We got enough Resin this trip!

Misfortune FK HE: Sudden Life. Everyone takes 1 direct damage to the Head. No problem!.

To the showdown we go! I'm very optimistic.
