||LY 15 - Freedom||

We have 8 endeavors.


Special Parallel Play rules for the year! An injured Red Initiate walks into town. We choose to spare her to be able to act as if we have the Bloodskin for events for the remainder of the  campaign! We also get free endeavors at Sanguine Extrusion and Hemodialysis this year, which we will be making use of.


Random SE: Gathering Emissions (again?): 8. beegoo suffers a concussion (ignoring the Disorder thanks to the Almanac) and gives us a ???.


Hooded Knight. This motherfucker...: 5! Nothing of note happens and Hooded Knight is added to LY 19.


A Warm Virus (Blueborn edition!): I will nominate Heart for the role, as they're a nice blank canvas for Blueborn to work with in their new life.

Roll result: 8. We have Sculpture, so departing survivors will gain a ton of insanity instead of Courage while departing this year. Oh well!

I think last time I passed along the Guest's Courage and Understanding, and that was a mistake. A bit late to un-do now, but I won't do it this time despite my desire to! Oopsies!

Blueborn is reborn into the body of Heart. Hopefully, they'll get us Shield mastery!


Sense Memory time!!! I'm so excited for once!!! We spend a Warbling Bloom, a sighing bloom, a monster organ, and a ??? for Scent of Lost Weath, providing Thorn with Otherworldly Luck!

Also, fuck it, I'll make a Vespertine bow just in case! We'll add Necrotoxic Mistletoe to the timeline on LY 19!

We add Otherworldly Luck to the Sculpture with one of our endeavors!


Innovation time!: Face Painting, Petal Spiral, Bloodletting, Records. Lmao.

Face Painting, in the bag.

I spend a total of 4 endeavors (2 hits and to misses) putting Otherworldly Luck on Leer and Rose respectively.

1 endeavor on Face Painting: 9. Now, if Leer and Rose participate together in Intimacy, we will have PLUS THREE to the roll, making it completely safe from death. I have 4 Love Juice in the bank :)


Here we go!!!


Intimacy results: 8, 6, 8, 8

+4 Pop and they both cap their survival. They even benefit from the Clan of Death bonuses we got last year!

We endeavor at no cost for Sanguine Extrusion and use our bounty from the Elastomer Mines to craft the remaining 3 pieces of the Black and Red Set!! 

Free Hemodialysis, I'll go ahead and toss that Rose's way. See what happens: 6! +1 permanent speed. Sure, why not.

Next up, I think we'll go ahead and use my last endeavor on beegoo's (technically ill-gotten, oopsies!) Matchmaker ability for one more Intimacy while we've got such a strong amp on it: 11! Twins! We'll go ahead and pop our remaining Warbling Bloom to get us up to 14 survivors. 


I've just remembered we have a Lantern Bud :). Our newborn Warbling Survivor, Brush, will consume it to get us 3 additional endeavors for the year. We'll convert a Perfect Organ into a Love Juice with Pottery and instantly use it.

9! Another set of twins! AND SOCIETY!! Finally!! Tempted as I am to take Collective Toil for the BK3 payoff, we will be Accepting Darkness. On a result of 8, we'll call our new survivor Society our Leader, giving her permanent Quixotic, Leader, and Orator of Death.


Before we spend our last two endeavors, we should take inventory of our available resources. We have a small set of particularly powerful survivors, strong abilities, and solid gear. What we're short on is time. I'd like to hunt a Dragon King at some point but I don't have anyone I'm comfortable using as a 'burner' survivor this year for the radiant core we'd get because we have sculpture. This means that our options are DK1, or DBK 1 or 2. I think it ends up being DBK 2. My prime concern is the tankiness of the beast in conjunction with our utter lack of Hit Location scouting. The trap will inflict 2 instances of 5 damage to us, and we have no way to mitigate or avoid that. Our attacking survivors can *broadly* eat that without taking severes, but it's not extremely comfortable. I'm opening myself up to a turn of bad luck.

So what's the issue with DBK1? For me, a significant issue is the lack of Scell to guarantee a Black Harvest Payout, and general lack of monster resources in general to make the myriad amazing DBK armor bits I'm excited about. In pursuit of my goal of getting all of the monster/nemesis armor sets I can this campaign, I'll need a bunch of DBK resources and time to make it happen, and I'm short on both. If I don't DBK2 now, when will my next opportunity be? LY 18 between BK and Nico. That's not bad, and still leaves us time for 2 rounds of Harvest before the end, hypothetically. What can change between now and then? We won't have new scouting. We might have our Black Knight armor set. We might have Shield Mastery for extra armor for people across the board.

We lose out on an opportunity to go into the Worm Tunnels because we won't be crossing Overwhelming Darkness. We lose some odds on Herb Gathering. Oh! Frogdog 3 is also an option. We've got to hunt Bullfrogdog to get access to the tuskworks at some point! No, I don't think that's quite yet. 17 toughness is quite high, even with the lilypads.

We will continue living in safety. DBK1. So, our endeavors will go toward pushing Shield Spec to completion, and converting some hides into leather, I think.

Blueborn Nightmare Training: 2>2>5. For lack of ways to produce more survival, we'll stop there.

As we depart, Blueborn hits 3 Understanding and nets us the Tithe Box seed pattern. Interesting, but difficult for us at present. I'll keep it in mind.

To DBK 1!
