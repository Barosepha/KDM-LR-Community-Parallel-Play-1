Our survivors Rise to the Challenge



Rose: 2

Misfortune: 10

Leer: 8

Heart: 2



Rose and Heart both lose 1 survival and gain Ptophobia and a -1 acc token

Misfortune gains +1 strength token

Leer gains Largesse. Conveniently, they're even Honorable already! Neat.

And that's all!

Oh, and our special rules for the year. Almost forgot! We identify the straggler as Misfortune, so they gain 2 -1 acc tokens and 1 elastomer. Yippee, we'll be nearly hitting on 10 with F\&T lmao. Leer's going to need to do a lot of work. This showdown is going to be tenuous.
