||LY 9 Settlement Phase - Challenger at the Gates||

Oh boy, this is an intimidating year. Essentially, we're going to make a gameplan to utilize all of our endeavors before we roll for a chance to lose them from the effects of the timer. Thankfully, we do have our Dragon Traited individual who benefits us for that roll, but there's also some unknown text from our special event rules this LY that I can only read after starting the timer, which is bound to put a wrench in things. For now, though, we at least get to do our Settlement Event for the year without a timer.

Random Settlement Event: Shapes in the Darkness. Neat, one of the new ones, even if it's intensely dangerous. 1-2 kills both of them with no death principle which is a total non-starter. I will nominate Sprout and Vine.

Roll result: 7. Each gains 2 insanity. 

The following is a summary of actions taken while on the timer from Challenger at the Gates, which I opted to not do active note taking on to save time. I recorded it, but it turned out that I didn't need to, as I completed the event after the first timer lol.

4 pieces of the Frogdog set and 1 Lure Lantern crafted, beegoo's intracranial hemorrhage was cured and she was provided Synchro Strike again, we innovated and got Inner Lantern (Wahoo! Surge! I'd really like Face Painting now please <3), gave Misfortune Synchro Strike (Turns out this was an error, we'll get to that) and then looked around considering options before the timer jumpscared me. Rolled a 10 so we missed the Arena bonus, but ended the timer ezpz. Misfortune gains 3 insanity, Thrill Seeker (replacing the Synchro we gave them) and Battle Drunk.

No we'll spend another endeavor to give them synchro again. Seems fair, the timer made me fail to think something through and so I lost a resource to it. We've got 4 endeavors remaining after all of that. I think I'll move to try and fix hemophobia on Blueborn since that could get pretty annoying in the Braal fight, I suspect.

10, random fighting art and disorder. Combo Master and Battle Drunk.

8, nothing

6, Hemophobia removed

1 endeavor left. We'll use it to give Blueborn back Synchronized Strike for completeness.

We've got 2 people with Battle Drunk, which is going to be some token management and also potentially somewhat dangerous for the fight ahead, but at the very lease we can get use out of the strength tokens when they overflow as survival with beegoo's Red Fist. I'm fearful of what -acc will do to us, but we have synchro with Forbidden Dance which should help cut downsides there before they snowball.
