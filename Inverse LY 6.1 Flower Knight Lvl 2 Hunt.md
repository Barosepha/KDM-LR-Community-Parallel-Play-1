||LY 6 Flower Knight Lvl 2 Hunt||

Yep, we're going for another Flower Knight this year. It's just too much good stuff too easy. We're still not  quite stable, so I'm going to take advantage while I can even though it's not going to progress my meta-goals like finishing armor sets quite yet. That's okay. Misfortune and beegoo hit Insight to gain Tinker and 1 accuracy this departure, lovely.


beegoo Event Revealer - Random Hunt Event: 27, Manstealers. Ouch.

Random Male Survivor selected is Drifter

Roll result: 3. Destroyed Genitals. +3 insanity a disorder [Arithmophilia 1, Jesus fucking christ] and 1 Bleed


Blueborn Event Revealer - Random Hunt Event: 40, Dream. +1 evasion token, no ribbons.


Misfortune Event Revealer - The Baby and the Sword.

Oh god, at least we did the right thing and left Leer (who has Coprolalia) at home this year. Fingers crossed.

Grab and Dash: 6. No harvester, lucky me. 1 disorder and the Sword of Silence or 3 Courage and a Newborn. Both are exceptionally tempting, as one is likely to be a population when I get home, which I could use desperately, and one insulates my survivors from the Dark Secret (a 40% chance of death, essentially.) Bonus points for being quite a competent weapon as well. I think it has to be the Sword of Silence. The Disorder they gain is Prey. Thankfully they have 8 insanity, so they're a little safe from the downside there for now.

This hunt event is removed from our deck now, so our Harvester odds return to normal. Awesome!


Drifter Event Revealer - Random Hunt Event: 85, Test of Courage

Nobody has enough courage to run for the sword, so we move on.


The Forest Wants What it Wants: 4

Rough, but not unrecoverable. First, everyone takes -1 strength token to bring us up to 8. We'll just eat the Bleeding Tokens and move on from here.


beegoo Event Revealer - Flower Knight Hunt Event: Shower

beegoo: 4, -1 acc token

Blueborn: 7, +1 armor [Body]

Misfortune: 5, +1 armor [Head]

Drifter: 10, +1 permanent Speed and Accuracy. Woah.


Blueborn Event Revealer - Flower Knight Hunt Event: Watched

Everyone's insanity is set to 0. Brutal, I was a little afraid of this but so it goes. We'll just need to hit Breakthrough a couple times. How bad could it be? Right?? We love a devastating 40 collective insanity and must forge on.

The Flower Knight is just ahead, and while circumstances could be better, they could be much worse. Barring some horrific misfortune, I think we'll be alright, realistically.
