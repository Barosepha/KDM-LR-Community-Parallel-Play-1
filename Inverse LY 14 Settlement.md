||LY 14 - The Final Plague||

We come home with 7 endeavors.

Random Settlement Event: Death. Kinda awesome! I don't love our population continuing to wiggle at such a low value and bring me further away from Principle: Society, but this is really great. We will kill our Honored Elder, Blueborn, content in the fact that they will return in a new body next year via their Sleeping Virus Flower. As an immediate consequence, we gain Clan of Death! All newborns are forever just a little bit stronger.

We gain a Monster Bone from Morgue, while I'm thinking about it, and a Monster Hide is added to our settlement storage thanks to Cannibalize.

Next, the Surgeon returns! We only have 1 dismembered arm that I'm not too worried about in the settlement though, so we'll leave them be.

I hope they're helpful for the oncoming Plague, though!

4 survivors with at least 1 Hunt XP must roll:

Root: 5. Sick but curable.

Rose: 1. No can do, reroll. 6. Sick but curable.

Heart: 8. Sick but curable.

And Misfortune, I guess: 4. Sick but curable. We will cure everyone with ammonia right now.

8, 6, 5, 6. No mass wipe, but everyone is cured for 4 of our endeavors.

Next, we'll innovate with 3 basic resources we have on hand.

Hovel, Pottery, Records, Scarification. Gotta be Pottery, I guess. Survival Limit, LOADS of good stuff, and no consequences.

Still. No. Face Painting. It's okay. 

Now, I was thinking about hunting a number of things that weren't Flower Knight this year. Dragon King could get us the cool nuclear dagger which might take us in the direction of the Master Bone Dagger I want to use so much. DBK is DBK, obviously. But we have pottery now. We could get Otherworldly luck straight from the tutor, drop it on our sculpture, and be set for the remainder of the campaign in that sense. That even serves as a Face Painting replacement! It's, just... Way too good to pass up lmao. Into the Flower Knight mines once more! For hopefully the FINAL TIME (for now.)

But not yet. There's still 2 endeavors to spend and a lot of gear grids and survivor sheets to shuffle about since we'll be going back on a proper hunt again for the next two lantern years.

I think I'll go ahead and throw one of my 2 precious remaining endeavors at Nightmare Training Misfortune, to finally get F&T Mastery completed.

Nightmare Training: 1. Instant Fail. Oh well. We'll spend 1 survival and not die.

Ah, right, our last endeavor is expected somewhere: Sanguine Extrusion.

We'll be  crafting up a Black and Red Armet and Cuirass. The helmet is important for making resin gathering better once we're deep in the mines, and the cuirass is just neat. 1 red thread and 4 resin away from our first full Black and Red set! Although we'll need another red thread to be able to put Transpose to use. Fingers crossed. 

Whatever happens, Misfortune will be going on her final Hunt this year. I can only hope it's a fruitful one.

On the other hand, as Leer is one of our limited survivors with Unconscious Fighter that we can use for deeper elastomer mine delves, I think I'll leave them behind this year in favor of another survivor. We'll also be swapping out Heart for Thorn just to wipe out a Flower Addiction. No reason not to really. I don't think I'll be going to a level 3 this year? For safety. 

--I slept on it--

I've got strong survivors. I just used up my second Sleeping Virus Flower. I might not fight Flower Knight again for the whole campaign, and definitely not soon if I have anything to say about it. I think we take out 2 monster survivors and make it happen. We'd be really relying on not seeing too many traps, I think. We also don't have any Leprosy survivors anymore to cut down incoming damage. It's a risk. Everywhere I'm looking makes the math seem bad. If I had more survivors to spare, I think I'd go for it. However, I don't. I took the risk on the last FK 3 because it was all or nothing and I had double leprosy to make damage numbers make sense. I don't have that anymore.

Alright, liveblog over. We take level 2, crit farm hard, and absolutely lock in our win condition: Warbling Bloom into Otherworldly Luck on the sculpture which solves the remainder of this campaign for us. I don't need additional risks right now, and the payoff isn't that high. Realistically it's ~3 more flowers, Sleeping virus flower, and black lichen. Only the Virus Flower is impactful there and not really what I need this second. If I miss both warbling blooms that's on me, but the statistics are intensely favored.

I have managed my grids, New beegoo and Misfortune will be our anchors. We're set up pretty well for our special hunt events too. Let's go!
