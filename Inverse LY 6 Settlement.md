||LY 6  - Drifter||

We come back hope with a handful of nice new mats and 6 Endeavors thanks to our 2 Tinkers that set out. Nothing unusual happens so we can get straight into it.

Random Settlement Event: Haunted

Fortune, staying alone back at the settlement, appears to have been convinced that there's a ghost. She rolls a 1 on the event, and unfortunately must be Exiled to maintain our settlement's productivity.

Luckily, a Drifter has come to replace them in our settlement. We roll 10 on their introduction event, giving the Drifter +1 Disposition and +1 Strength to two other survivors. I'll use that to bring Blueborn back up to 1 Strength and increase Leer's to 2.

Next up, the Flower Knight has lent us a Sense Memory. Unfortunately, for lack of Pottery and Sculpture, I'll be abstaining from anything that it offers.

I'll begin by spending an Endeavor to Forbidden Dance away our 4 Osseous Blooms and a Lantern Bloom for 5 replacement Basic Resources:

Hide x2
Love Juice
???
Monster Bone

Sure thing.

I'll go ahead and Innovate now using an endeavor, Monster Hide, Monster Organ, and a Skull (not our fancy special one!)

Conveniently, I am currently lacking Inner Lantern and Symposium, so I'm able to benefit from this year's Settlement Phase rules and pluck Symposium from the Innovation deck. Bringing us straight up to 6 Survival Limit and also making our future innovations much higher quality on average. Wonderful stuff.

1 endeavor, 2 Sighing Blooms, 1 Monster Organ, and 1 Monster Hide makes for a Barber Surgeon.

In pulling the Barber Surgeon out, it looks like my Black Knight Settlement Events weren't in the deck. Funky, wonder why they popped out. Oh well, 20-some more years remain to potentially see them.

1 Perfect Hide and 1 Lantern Bud makes for a Scavenger's Kit. Love to see it this relatively early on!

We'll archive our Warbling Bloom to get a new survivor, Buddy, bringing our population to a barely passable 6.

Now that we've got a Barber Surgeon, I can finally get to work on trepanning off these pesky Disorders I dislike so much. First target is Fear of the Dark on Blueborn: 3, relief. The Disorder is cured and he is no longer retired. Next, Coprolalia on Leer. I'm not keen on one of my very few survivors dying guaranteed on the very significant odds of a Harvester showing up one of these hunts: 10. He gains a Disorder and Fighting Art instead. Armored Fist (currently useless on them) and Seizures. Not too bad. We'll try again: 9. Functionally nothing. Unfortunate, but such are dice. At least we got rid of Fear of the Dark for now.

A relatively simple Settlement Phase, all things considered. Next year we have Hooded Knight returning to worry about, who may burden us with the Twilight Sword inconveniently, but there's not a huge amount we can really do about it if it happens. I think we may be leaving Leer at home this coming year, as much as I'd like to continue progressing Katar proficiency, since Coprolalia is such a liability and getting Drifter out and about seems useful. It's extremely likely that I'll be hunting Flower Knight 2 again, as it's such a simple and effective loot pinata, but considering the Leprosy we've got I'm also seriously considering Screaming Antelope 2 in the hopes of getting our hands on the remainder of this Screaming armor set as opposed to another mountain of 'generic' resources, as great as that is to have. We'll have to wait and see what the next week has in store for us.
