||LY 16 Pariah Lvl 2 Showdown||

I'm intimidated, but we're going into this fight very prepared. Additionally, our special rules for the year allow everyone to opt to take 2 damage to 2 random hit locations to gain a somatic static token, which we will absolutely take advantage of for every single survivor. The damage has landed in some bad looking spots, but it's still bound to be worthwhile.

Our random terrain is an Ore Vein and a Giant Stone Face. I was considering bringing a Pick to the showdown for this very situation, but didn't. Oh well.

On arrival, red fist triggers giving everyone a str token, and we get Attack Pattern and Quad Strike for our Tactics. Excellent stuff. Here we go.


Round 1 [Society MC]:

We go first.

Survivors' Turn:

We have a Death Mask Vespertine Bow. We'll use it.

Vespertine Bow attack: 3, 4, 7 (1 hit.) We crit on 4.

Wicked Ancillary Arms: 3. Fuck, man. Thankfully this reaction does literally nothing.

Surge

Vespertine Bow attack: 10, 6, 10 (1 hit, 2 perfect.)

TRAP!!! 3rd card in the deck. So it goes, at least we aren't getting hit by some unavoidable somatic empathy for it.

Basic action [Blueborn]

Pariah moves to adjacent

Attack rolls: 10, 3, 9 (2 hits.)

Fencing: 1

3 damage to Waist and Legs. There are worse traps. Doesn't mean I'm happy to see this one.

Act ends

Stew acts

Move and dash into synchro + blind spot

At this point I'm just frustrated

Movement and Dash (refund!) into Blind Spot

Sword of Silence attack: 10, 8 (2 hits. Wicked Ancillary Arms, Rubicon Steel Heel)

Wicked Ancillary Arms: Natural 10! (Critical Wound)

Pariah and Rose both gain a -1 Speed token. Awesome, honestly. That's like a 33% damage output reduction for the monster on a lot of cards.

Cyclopean Empathy: Cyclopean Singularity. Nope. Absolutely not. Somatic static and it's gone (For now)

Rubicon Steel Heel (Parry): Natural 7 (Failure)

Rose is Knocked Down. Not too bad, all things considered.


Round 2 [Blueborn MC]:

Everyone stands with F&T spec

AI Draw: Prehensile Kick [Rose]

Attack rolls: 8, 1 (1 hit. Legs)

Dodged for sure.

Cyclopean Cruelty AI Draw: Savage Push [Rose]

Attack rolls: 5, 10 (1 hit. Waist)

3 waist damage, bash, knockback 5 through Society, +1 somatic static. Don't mind if I do.

Survivors' Turn:

Attack order is Blueborn > Stew > Rose > Leer

Society stands with F&T spec

Blueborn acts

Movement to a favorable position

Vespertine Bow attack: 2, 3, 8 (1 hit.)

Malingering Knuckles: Natural 4 (Critical Wound)

The crit doesn't do anything in particular in this case

Battle Drunk Triggers

Surge

Vespertine bow attack: 5, 6, 5 (3 hits. Wicked Bony Shin, Bloodstained Blindfold, Wicked Toenail)

Wicked Bony Shin (First Strike): Natural 10! (Wound)

Stew dashes out of the way of the reaction

Cyclopean Empathy: Two Toe Claw Kick.  Gain 2 - attribute tokens of my choice. - str, ezpz.

Bloodstained Blindfold: Natural 5 (Critical Wound)

Blueborn suffers Blind and gains Iron Will. Awesome! Amazingly, suffering blind would give them a Bleeding token and knock them down because of Hemophobia, but Iron Will keeps them standing! Rad.

Cyclopean Empathy: Rend the Shroud. -1 acc token. Okay, sure.

Wicked Toenail: Natural 4 (Critical Wound)

Blueborn archives all their negative attribute tokens. Gladly!

Cyclopean Empathy: Vindictive. Suffer Clarity. That'll kill Blueborn, so we'll happily spend a Somatic static token to avoid that and stop attacking with them since it could be retriggered unavoidably via the trap. Shame, but we got a lot of value out of the crit build already. Hopefully we can take it the rest of the way home without it.

Act ends

Stew acts

Blueborn dashes into Synchro

Grappleclaw attack: 10, 4, 2>3 (3 hits. Bloodstained Tresses, Bloodstained Cape, Malingering Forearm)

Blueborn spends 1 survival to convert Bloodstained Cape into a Failure reaction.

Bloodstained Tresses: 17 (Wound)

Cyclopean Empathy: Covetous Frenzy. 1 Head damage ignoring armor. Scary but not too bad right now.

Bloodstained Cape: 14 (Wound)

Cyclopean Empathy: Uh oh. Cognitive Perdition. An opportunity to perform sundering, but 2 brain traumas with -7 to the result is almost certain death lmao. We'll use a Somatic Static token to prevent that certain doom.

Malingering Forearm: 14 (Wound)

Cyclopean Empathy: Upon the Pyre. -1 Speed token. Not bad at all, really.

Halfway through the hit location deck, and the trap is potentially absolutely brutal right now. Spooky.

AI Draw: Sudden Inversion [Society]

This card will kill their ass lmao.

Society Surges to Block with the Hyperelastic Shield

Attack rolls: 7, 4, 5 (3 hits)

The hyperelastic shield blocks 1 hit, and then bounces Society away to safety, cancelling the remaining hits.

Cyclopean Cruelty AI Draw: Whirlwind Pursuit [Society]

Rude.

The monster walks through Rose to Society

Attack rolls: 6, 10 (1 hit. Waist)

No point in dodging, it'll just play the card again if it does not damage. 4 Waist damage. I get a Somatic Static token, silver lining.

This will be a brutal trap. We'll see!

Grappleclaw: 8, 6 (2 hits. Malingering Knee, Wicked Cape Collar.) No trap yet. Running out of space for it.

Malingering Knee: Natural 1 (Failure) Ugh.

Glimpse thankfully does nothing because all of the AI cards are in the Discard right now.

Wicked Cape Collar: Natural 1. (Failure.) Come on, man...

Pariah teleports behind Stew and hits them in the arms for 3, causing a severe injury that's blocked by Dried Acanthus. Stew takes knockback 5 and a somatic static token.

Act ends


Round 4 [Rose MC]:

AI Draw: Sudden Inversion [Society]

We're 1 space to close to dash out of this card, unfortunately. 8 Movement is tough.

Society surges a Block with the Hyperelastic shield that won't save her this time.

Attack rolls: 10, 6, 1 (1 hit after Block. Body)

Movement to adjacency

Attack rolls: 3, 10 (1 hit. Head)

Dodged (refund!)

Cyclopean Cruelty AI Draw: Whirlwind Pursuit [Stew]

Stew Dashes to a slightly better position to save some annoying knockdowns and what have you.

Attack rolls: 7, 6 (2 hits. Body, Waist.)

We dodge the waist damage because that'd be a Severe.

4 damage to the Body and a Somatic Static token.

Survivors' Turn:

Society acts

Movement into Blind Spot

Beast Knuckle attack: 8, 5 (2 hits. Guaranteed trap, finally)

Trap! It was the second to last card this time. Luck evens out a little, I suppose, although we were playing scared of it for some time here. 

Society reveals 2 cards from the Wound stack, triggering Cyclopean Empathy:

Upon the Pyre. -1 Spd token.

Cognitive Perdition. Scary! But this is the best person to take it... 2 Brain Traumas with net +/- 0 thanks to Accept Darkness: 10. Frenzy. Fine, really. 5. Danger Seziure. We're surviving.

All in all, +8 insanity, Battle Drunk, and Frenzy. Now, on to Sundering.

Sundering: 9. Well, we didn't die, but we don't get a survivor immune to Somatic Empathy, unfortunately. Society suffer gains 2 Somatic Static tokens and loses Battle Drunk. Would have been good to have, but I'm glad they lived, at least.

Act ends

On a fresh deck, and seeing all the available Somatic Empathy punishes from the remaining AI cards, I'm willing to take a mild risk here.

Blueborn acts

Vespertine Bow (Giant Stone Face buffed): 10, 4, 1 (1 hit.)

Bloodstained Tresses: Natural 1 (Failure)

Surge

Vespertine Bow: 5, 8, 4 (2 hits.)

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.

Trap. Third hit location in the deck again. If I get perdition again I'm going to be pissed, man. 4 cards from the wound stack:

Hold Me Close, Sadistic Break, Whipping Away, and Cyclopean Singularity.

We'll swap tokens with someone first, gain the -1 str and mov tokens, and then put Singularity into play.

Not too horrible. Rose is freed from a lot of tokens, and Blueborn is laden with many that don't particularly affect them.
