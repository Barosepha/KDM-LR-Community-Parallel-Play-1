||LY 11 Settlement - Tragedy||

We have no returning survivors. We get 1 endeavor from Cooking.

The Parallel Play special rules introduce us to a surgeon who will return in some time. I'll ask them to come back in 3 years. We'll either have use for their services, or be gone by then.

Settlement Event: Heat Wave. Not a lot of note occurs.

Hooded Knight: 5. They do nothing and will come back LY 15.


We can at least innovate with our single endeavor and stored resources.

Records, Morgue, Shrine, and Petal Spiral. Incredibly disappointing. That being said, we do have Cannibalize and a Death Count that has newly surpassed 10. We'll take Morgue and move on with our day. Unfortunately, we've already passed the start of the develop step, so we won't benefit from it this year. 


There is now a question to be asked about whether or not I should commit to starting to use my Love Juice to try and stabilize my population. My answer is no. I don't have face painting. If I die I die, but I'm  going out to a monster or some tragic settlement event, not killing myself pointelessly with reroll-less no face painting SotF intimacy using exclusively powerful survivors that can fight.

So that's it, that's our settlement phase. I'll figure out what I'm hunting next year later, but obviously this sets us back rather dramatically. One can only hope we'll have an equally explosive positive turn of fortune in the coming years.
