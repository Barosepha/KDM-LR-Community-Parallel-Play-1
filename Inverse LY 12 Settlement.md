||LY 12 Settlement Phase - Conviction||

4 Tinkers and Cooking, we have 9 Endeavors

Settlement Event: Gathering Emissions, 9. Leer suffers a Concussion and finds a ??? for us.

Leer gains Anhedonia from the concussion. We might want to get that off of them when we can, it's mildly annoying if they suddenly gain a lot of courage soon.

Principle Conviction! Like hell I'm adding Hands of Heat to my timeline next year, we're taking Romantic.

I roll a 3 on the event, but with the fated +5 from the Parallel Play special rules laid out from the very start, my resources are mercifully saved. I'll go ahead and cap out beegoo's Understanding (to no effect thanks to the Sword of Silence) and give them Legendcaller.

It's the Holidays! I'll wait until I organize everything to resolve this and add the details here -

We send off 1 Iron in our holiday gift and receive back a Radiant Heart! Devious, as the poor recipient may be incinerated. Unfortunately, I think we'll need to inflict this destruction on beegoo. They've got a Sleeping Virus Flower, but we'll lose Legendcaller. Let's roll: 4, Incinerated, dead. Our poor population dwindles further. A Warm Virus is added to the next year on the timeline and we are treated to a Monster Bone added to our settlement storage.


Sighing Bloom, Lantern Bloom, Osseous Bloom, and an Endeavor makes an Innovation:

Scrap Smelting, Hovel, Records, Pictograph. Immeasurably dogshit lineup, pure dead  draws in the truest sense lol. But I'm glad I'm here to have the opportunity to draw it regardless. Records is tempting as a no-consequence option. Pictograph throws Memento Mori into my deck which is alright and activate the Skrelle Settlement Event if I stumble upon that, in addition to improving a couple Hunt Events here and there and giving me access to Almanac. I think I might as well take it, even though it doesn't thin the deck toward Face Painting or other stuff I want at all.

Next thing that happens no matter what, 2 Warbling Blooms make 2 Population. We begin clawing our way back up.

Root and Weed are our new Warbling-faced survivors.

I'm going to Nightmare Train to try and finish Katar Mastery once and for all.

Leer Nightmare Training: 7, 10, +1 Acc (ate a Sighing Bloom for 3 survival and 3 Insanity, plus gaining Flower Addiction to clear Anhedonia)

Again (After eating another Bloom): 5, 10, +1 Acc

Again (We eat our Screaming Brain to cap out survival): 10, +1 Str

Again: 9, Katar Mastery!!! Yay :)

4 endeavors left.

It's worth mentioning here how we are unfortunately in a sort of Flower Knight feedback loop. Because of our survivors that are Skipping next hunt, if we hunt anything other than Flower Knight, we'll have to head out with a grand total of 2 survivors instead of 4. Maybe we will and will hunt something easy like a level 1 Frogdog or lope maybe. Tough to say for sure.

In the meantime, I feel compelled to try to Nightmare Train with Blueborn to get a little closer to Shield Mastery.

Blueborn Nightmare Training: 9, +1 shield proficiency.

We'll craft up a new pair of Rawhide Pants to replace the ones we lost to the Sleeping Virus Flower this past hunt.

3 Osseous Blooms, a Lantern Bloom, and an endeavor makes a weapon crafter. Maybe we'll be able to take some time to get Scrap Smelting as a bonus innovation later.

We'll go ahead and lose the last of our flowers for a monster tooth necklace. Never know when we'll need it.

Last two endeavors go to our newly departing flower survivors to give them Synchronized Strike.

And we'll go ahead and set out for a level 2 Flower Knight, as we must.
