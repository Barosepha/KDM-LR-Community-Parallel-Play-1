||LY 2 Settlement Phase - Lingering Effects||


First things first, our returning survivors gift us with a total of 4 endeavors to play with, and we are provided the choice of 3 specific Settlement Events this year per the special rules of this Parallel Play event:

Dark Dentist: Mend Bones and Monster Tooth Dentures are reduced in cost by 2 bones each, plus a little upside. Very enticing to improve Doug as our F&T Mastery Candidate right now, coin flip on +1 str or potentially 1 spd for 2 bones ain't bad.

Open Maw: Before we roll, we can spend 2 resources up to two times to gain the ability to remove 1 die from our final roll result up. I really hate the uncertainty here, because there's real odds you're throwing 2 resources down the drain for nothing at such a volatile part of the campaign. It's undeniably full of potential, though. With one expenditure and wise Dice choices you can have pretty excellent odds of getting at least +2 courage on a survivor, which may net us a Matchmaker this year if we choose wisely, or if we run worse odds and get lucky we could get a Lantern Sword, which would be completely insane this early, or a survivor with Iron Will, which is pretty neat and novel. I think I've only had one such survivor before from a Hunt Event in the 90's.

Dark Trader: Jeweled Thong and Strange brew have their costs reduced all the way to 1, and if we nominate a Mere Navi to benefit they'll get +1 on their rolls for purchases. A huge buff to the event, but it's still a little hard to justify. Assuming our Mere Navi survives their ascension, we'd be spending 1 resource for either 20% odds of +1 luck and 10% for -1 accuracy, 20% odds to gain 1 accuracy, 10% death, and 70% Intracranial Hemorrhage and Rageholic, or 2 resources for 70% to gain a Founding Stone and 20% to gain Immortal. If the Pink Stone option were also reduced to 1 resource as well I'd be more enticed, because that's not a bad deal by any means. The Pink Thong also isn't the worst investment in the world. Hit that 20% chance and it'll pay for itself. Miss it and you've thrown a potentially important resource down the drain.

For me, this is between the Open Maw and the Dark dentist, as I'll either almost certainly aim to get Monster Tooth Dentures for Doug if I take the dentist, or just spend 2 resources and pray to hit a Lantern Sword or at least some Courage from Open Maw using a reroll and one of the special die removals.

Essentially, this is looking like 2 bones are headed down the drain for either a Maw run or these dentures.

The Maw is splashier and may net us some Vermin that could very well be Crab Spiders that can be Hide. We'll go for it.

Now, we've got other stuff to do before we can return to the Open Maw:

Endless Screams. Frustratingly, I was anticipating throwing Shoeborn in as the nominee for this event to guarantee a Bold roll and Matchmaker. Unfortunately, no such luck as they're Hamstrung. It'd be a bit of a waste. I'll use her brother Blueborn instead.

1. That'd be a Shattered Jaw and net 0 courage on the event. Bit of a waste, and our settlement is fresh. I'll use an unnamed survivor's reroll to give it another go. 4! Much better. Overall +1 Courage and Understanding and our returning survivors gain 1 insanity. Also, we can hunt the Screaming antelope now.

Next up, Lingering Cough. Shoeborn will be our prospective Mere Navi, as they probably aren't coming out much more here on out. We innovate Mere Omens and roll: 10! In many ways this is the least interesting outcome for us, but oh well. Shoeborn gains Feral Shout added to their collection of unusable Fighting Arts and become our Mere Navi


No more Story Events, now we're free. First things first, we Innovate:

Hovel or Song of the Brave. Hovel is tempting because Departing Survival would be pretty nice right now, but the trap remains a trap. I wouldn't like to increase my deck's thickness quite that much without Symposium or my other core innovation choices, none of which are hidden behind Hovel. Song of the Brave, on the other hand, does almost nothing for us now, but we want it in the future and it leads to our good friend Saga. We'll be taking it.


Now let's return to the Open Maw. My instinct says I should roll 6 dice. I haven't done any particular math since it'd be a bit of a pain, but that's the ballpark to hit the lantern sword on average or at least get us some vermin if we don't. Some quick napkin math tells me that's completely insane, however. I'll do 5 and we'll see what happens. Risky as it is, I'll be nominating Blueborn for the shot at Bold. We'll also be spending our two Spindly Paws in order to have the failsafe single die removal.

10, 4, 7, 3, 4

28 with one duplicate. If we remove the 4, that lands us squarely on 24. 2 courage and 2 vermin. Tempted as I am to hit it with a reroll, the wise path is to take what's good while I've got it. Blueborn finds 2 vermin [Golden Frog, Fiddler Crab Spider] and becomes Bold, gaining the Matchmaker ability and rolling a 10 for +1 permanent Accuracy. I wouldn't have complained about an extra endeavor, but I can't pretend that isn't excellent.


Crafting: We'll pick up a Spiked Buckler and set of Frogdoggles, leaving us with a Waxy Dermis and Mossy Molar, plus the Skull and Burnished Encephalomatter we saved from last year. Our Hide situation really is unpleasantly tight, but our weapons are now varied and quite effective for our current position. All things considered, I wouldn't have complained about seeing another organ as well, as I could activate a Lucky Charm with my Grappleclaw and Frogdoggles now. Unfortunately that must wait for the moment unless I'd like to intentionally kill someone with Open Maw on the off chance I pull an organ there with Cannibalize. Probably not worthwhile.

We also have a Golden Frog, which does more or less do nothing for us for the time being, and a Fiddler Crab which poses an interesting conundrum of its own. We could either use it as hide with our Waxy Dermis and pick up a Rawhide Headband and Vest, strengthening our armor base a solid bit and getting us AI scouting which would reduce my showdown stress levels a little bit against this unpredictable Frog. Alternatively, we could greed and bank it for use in the future when we have a survivor further along with F&T and some Arm armor to make that grind a lot easier. Realistically, I think the correct choice is obvious. We're getting two pieces of Rawhide.


Now we sit with 2 endeavors, a Golden Frog, a Mossy Molar, a Skull, and a choice.

I think the sensible thing to do in this position is to set Doug up with Synchro Strike paired with another survivor, or ALTERNATIVELY, we could go gambling with the Maw some more using these last two endeavors. More Courage is good Courage, and on the off chance we get more Hide vermin we're suddenly in an amazing position. I think I'll use the Open Maw once more.

Lawrence, who stayed behind with the Lantern Hoard last year, conveniently has 1 courage already, perfect for getting another Bold survivor.

He'll venture into the Open Maw using the Golden Frog and a Skull for protection. 5 dice again.

6, 5, 4, 3, 3

We remove the second 3 and end up at 18. Not my ideal result, but another Bold survivor is great to see. Lawrence gains Matchmaker and rolls a 3, allowing us to reroll an endeavor this settlement phase. I think I know what we'll be using it for. Our unnamed survivor with no reroll and Aichmophobia will be using our last endeavor to dive in with no failsafe resources, but one reroll thanks to from tips about the Maw from his Bold friend Lawrence. I'll do them the service of naming them Maw before the outcome is decided. 5 dice, one more time.

10, 6, 8, 6, 1

Almost an excellent result. Exactly what I would have wanted would I have had another batch of failsafe resources. Instead, they're forced to reroll the whole thing. 

9, 4, 1, 4, 9

And thus, Maw was lost. At the very least, he's kind enough to provide us with 1 Monster Hide from Cannibalizing the body spat out by the Maw, which we'll put to use as Rawhide Gloves to fill out the basic Rawhide trifecta. Thanks, Maw.

We're now lined up with a full 'set' of armor for one survivor with 3 pieces of rawhide, Frogdog legs, and Cloth.

We'll have to do all sorts of survivor shuffling because beegoo is forced to Skip the Next Hunt due to her Spiral Fracture, and Shoeborn is staying home as the Mere Navi after becoming Hamstrung. Lawrence will be joining Blueborn and Doug in addition to a new as of yet Unnamed Survivor. Unfortunately, this leaves Doug vulnerable as a Murder target for the time being, but it's really too early to be worrying about that right now. Better to have him out and progressing than messily shuffling survivors around on the off chance my 1 F&T Proficiency survivor lasts longer. Our new hunter will be gifted the name Steeple and equipped with the Long Club, Blueborn will be moved over to the Spiked Buckler, and Lawrence will be provided the full armor set and Grappleclaw.

We are afforded one last crucial choice. Hunt another Frogdog in pursuit of a full armor set and maybe slightly more hide proportionally, or hunt a Lope for a couple extra crit opportunities with the Spiked Buckler, an overall simpler fight, and optimistically a Bladder so we can put together Blood Paint and really turn this Spiked Buckler inter a monster early game tool. I will be doing the latter, lope just sounds way too good right now for various reasons. We've even got Song of the Brave in case it chooses to run over Overwhelming Darkness.

We set out to hunt our first Screaming Antelope.
