||LY 11 Flower Knight Lvl 3 Showdown||

(Editor's note from the future, totally forgot to deal the 2 bonus wounds and lose 2 survival on some survivors from this year's Parallel Play special rules! Thankfully, the survival loss was completely mitigated from our First Aid Kit and the 2 extra wounds would have only made me less stressed lmao.)

Following our strange path from the settlement deep past the Forest Gate, we Ambush the Flower Knight! A major boon in our time of need. Setup time. Our random terrain this showdown is a Mammoth Leaf in addition to the prescribed 3 Flower Patches. Presumably not necessary, but it may come in handy.


I'm going to start denoting 2x2 monster position by their bottom left most space so I have less to type in general.

Flower Knight: [1,4] N facing

Mammoth Leaf: [4-7,8-10]

Flower Patches: [5,1], [6,1], and [7,1]

beegoo [3,3]

Misfortune [6,2]

Blueborn [3,6]

Leer [3,8]

On arrival, everyone gains 3 survival from First Aid Kit, 1 Str token from Red Fist, and Leer gains 3 insanity from the Screaming Leg Warmers. Leer also gains the Priority Target token from Anxiety.


Round 1 [Blueborn MC]:

Monster Turn is skipped by virtue of the Ambush.

Survivors' Turn:

Heart of the Forest causes everyone Knockback 5 to the nearest board edge (I won't be doing specific positions for these since it's a lot and it's trivial to ascertain from provided information)

Flower Patch: Guaranteed luck token and Flower Resource [Lantern Bloom]

Movement to [5,2]

Act ends

Blueborn acts

Rawhide Headband: Attenuating Weeds, Glissade. Glissade is maybe one of the least threatening cards in the whole FK deck, but letting Attenuating Weeds hit the board basically skips a monster turn and inflicts a wound for free. I will be doing that just to minimize the duration of this showdown. If I lose a couple Luck tokens in the process, I don't mind. The Hit Location deck is getting thin, we'll hit the trap soon, I know it.

Movement to [2,7]

Act ends
