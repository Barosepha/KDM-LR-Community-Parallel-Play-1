||LY 18 Dung Beetle Knight Lvl 2 Showdown||


Level 2 DBK is never trivial! But we're well prepared for this one. I'm optimistic.

Alright, lots going on this fight. We'll start with Arrival: Red Fist gives everyone a Str token, Count armor spends 3 of Stew's survival for 2 str and a movement token, but that survival is refunded by First Aid Kit.


Next, the special rules for this year! We arrive at the aftermath of a brutal duel between a level 3 flower knight and a level 2 Dung Beetle Knight. There is a Fairy Ring on the field that kills the Bug Spot, and a Dead Monster that the DBK starts next to. (Ball ignores the fairy ring for this fight, kindly.)

Additionally, the DBK gains TWO luck tokens and 1 accuracy token. Brutal stuff for us and our Death Mask Vespertine Bow survivor, since it also gained 1 damage from the hunt event we did earlier, but all we can do is deal with it. We do gain one more excellent benefit: We can automatically critically wound one Persistent Injury HL this showdown. That should be helpful. May even be able to abuse it if we're lucky.

Oh, and our Tactic from DBK Badge this year is Lance Formation. Nothing special, not bad! I might use it for my opening.

We will be also abusing the specific placement rules for the showdown to have the ball start as far away from DBK as possible. Should be good for us. I've stopped going into placement specifics, but just know our opening positions thanks to this Dead Monster and special parallel play rules are fucked (Positive.) 


Let's open up this fight by going psychopath aggro with the Count armor and if we get punished we get punished.

We got ALMOST everything we needed, but we whiffed the Underplate Fungus for a full set of Rolling armor. We were going to do a second Black Harvest anyway, it's alright. We just need to hit the Fungus from that fight to get it done.

PLUS 1 Sleeping Virus Flower from our Special Rules this year. Gotta figure out who'll receive it. I think Blueborn is probably correct, and we just kill our DBK badge since it's pretty easy to replace if we want it back, and it extends our already very deep crit range and guarantees we have a survivor with Luck for the future, even if they won't get the Iron Will. Oh, but if they die they would lose the Death Mask. Stew has the best stats otherwise.
Spelunking of Death.

Yeah.. I suppose it's Stew and just avoiding Blueborn's second death. We'll kill our bandaids for it since we just got a ton of hide anyway. They'll be easy to replace.

For Spelunking of Death, I'll nominate Root and Stew.

Root: 5. +1 Courage.

Stew: 3. 1 more Preserved Caustic Dung, which I'm happy to take. 

And we're homeward bound!
