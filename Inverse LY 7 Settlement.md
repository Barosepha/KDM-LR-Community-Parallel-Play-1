||LY 7 - Return of the Hooded Knight||

I hate this guy. We return with 4 survivors, 3 of whom are Tinkers, netting us 7 endeavors this year. Comfortable.

Special settlement rules for this year, I nominate Misfortune since they're training F&T anyway. I'm reluctant to lose Crazed because of the last Stain I'd like to collect over the course of this campaign, but realistically I'll lose it or this survivor anyway so they'll go ahead and keep Unbreakable and Fated Blow of the 3 Fighting Arts they're gifted.

Note: Ding ding! Second Cheat identified this week! Forgot Misfortune had Prey and spent survival three times, I think. Again, oopsies but so it goes. All the more reason to get Prey off of them when I can.

Random Settlement Event: Glossolalia. This could be a little annoying. I nominate the Drifter.

Roll result: 6. They gain Endless Babble. Nothing lost, some gain. Peachy.

Hooded Knight time: 5. Ideal, nothing happens again and they will return on LY 11. 

Sense Memory hits gain. Think I'll skip again for now. Might craft some things in hindsight but probably not.

Next up, The Drifter adopts their own special Philosophy, Hyper Light. They gain the Chain Dash theory Knowledge, which will rank up to Chain Dash II after they Dash 3 times, easy enough considering they also gain the Afflicted Neurosis, which causes them to be knocked down and Bleed 1 if they end an act without having dashed in the round. Note to self, gotta be more on top of their Survival refreshing every round as well, not that it really mattered this past showdown. They also roll on the rank 1 table: 1. I'll use Buddy's Lifetime Reroll to encourage the Drifter to do better > Lantern 10! Delightful. The Drifter gains 2 Disposition, 1 Luck, and skips the next hunt. Absolutely fine and great.


Innovation, Osseous Bloom, Sighing Bloom, Lantern Bloom and an Endeavor:

Pictograph, Cooking, Petal Spiral, and Hovel. Exceptionally mid stuff, but I really love me some Cooking. I'll take it.

2 Warbling Blooms simply must become more population. Gladly. Sprout and Vine are born into the settlement, bringing us up to 8 population.

Now, we've got a number of pretty bad disorders to cut up with our Barber Surgeon and spare endeavors.

Leer endeavors at the Barber Surgeon: 5. Coprolalia is removed!

Misfortune endeavors at the Barber Surgeon: 9, nothing.

Again: 10, Rhythm Chaser and Secretive. Annoying but so it  goes.

Again: 8, nothing.

Again: 3. Prey is removed, but now Secretive is here to bother us. You win some you lose some. I think I'll feed the Lantern Bud to one of my newborns for 3 more endeavors this year.

1 goes toward cycling our remaining 5 flowers for a small stack of Basic Resources:

Monster Hide
???
Monster Organ
Broken Lantern x2

Unique stuff, I'll take it.

I'll throw Misfortune to the Barber Surgeon wolves again: 6. Secretive is removed. 

She will then endeavor at Drums to get Synchronized Strike back

Then we'll make a Stone Noses. I've been missing those, so I'm happy to get a copy finally.

Our Fresh Acanthus will be going toward a Dried Acanthus, yes please.

Our bank is getting quite well suited to producing a full leather set and other treats once we find Ammonia, if we find Ammonia. Fingers crossed. I think we'll be after a Screaming Antelope level 2 this coming year. Hopefully we dismantle it rapidly and get the Spiral Horn and Pelt I so dearly desire to finish our Screaming set. Then we can move on to Frogdog, probably.
