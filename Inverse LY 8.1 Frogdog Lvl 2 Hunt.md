||LY 8 Frogdog Lvl 2 Hunt||


Of note, we finally have bone picks and a bone sickle. We'll be placing the mineral gathering on top of the herb gathering on the first space after Overwhelming Darkness.


beegoo event revealer - Random Hunt Event: 05, Flesh Fields. Everyone loses 1 survivor and beegoo rolls on the table with +4 thanks to Misfortune's Sickle: 10. Lmao I'm glad to have more hide. EVERY survivor harvests 1 basic Hide resource, so we net 4.

Blueborn event revealer - Frogdog Hunt Event: Euphony, Blueborn takes 5 brain damage.

Misfortune event revealer - Random Hunt Event: 45, Jagged Valley. Everyone eats 1 Body damage and Misfortune rolls on the table [7] and gains a Hissing Cockroach and Iron, in addition to rolling again on the hunt event table:

Bonus Random Hunt Event: 12, Destiny Bound. Misfortune gains 1 Courage and we may skip the next hunt space. We'll go ahead and do that.

Leer event revealer - Frogdog Hunt Event: Bouncing Leaves. This one sucks.

beegoo: 2, Broken Arm. Annoying but they have high stats anyway so it's fine.

Blueborn: 4, We archive our Blood Paint. Highly annoying but so it goes. Hopefully we'll get another Bladder in the future to get it back.

Misfortune: 6, +1 insanity. 

Leer: 5, Nothing happens.


Overwhelming Darkness:

beegoo: 1, beegoo cannot spend survival, so she must lose 1 courage. I wanted that population, too :/

Blueborn: 6

Misfortune: 4

Leer: 6

-1 eva token and +2 survival for all of the others.

Mineral Gathering: Blueborn and Misfortune have pickaxes.

Blueborn: 2, +1 insanity and Hemophobia

Misfortune: 7, 1 Iron and we roll a second die: 10. The pickaxe snaps.

Herb Gathering: Everyone (that can) gains 1 survival

beegoo: 6, 6, 7 (0)

Blueborn: 2, 8, 4 (14)

Misfortune: 5, 3, 3 (0)

Leer: 7, 4, 8 (19)

+10 for being past overwhelming darkness, our final result is 43. Just missed the result we actually want. +1 Fresh Acanthus and survival for all applicable survivors.

beegoo event revealer: Interloper, 3. Beegoo suffers 2 damage to the Body.


Pretty bad hunt phase, all in all, but far from the worst it could have gone. We came out of it with 4 hide and 2 Iron as well, which is good useful stuff for the future. I shan't complain too much, not every hunt is golden. 

The Frogdog lies ahead.
