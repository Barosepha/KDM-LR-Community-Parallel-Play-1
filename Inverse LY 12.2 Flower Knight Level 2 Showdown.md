||LY 12 Flower Knight Lvl 2 Showdown||

Should be easy peasy but there are some danger points. Notably, I have 13 bleeding tokens among my survivors that could use tidying up, and FK has some cards that inflict bleed plus Razor Bulbs. This will likely not be trivial.

Upon arrival, we're looking at 3 survival for everyone, wiping the -str tokens we took from the forest gate, and Weed gets +3 insanity from their Leg Warmers. Quad Strike is our Flower Knight Badge Tactic.

For my simplicity, I'll be slightly less completely exhaustive going forward in terms of precise positioning and I want to play a little faster  for the moment. On that note, our Random Terrain is an Ore Vein this year.
