||LY 2 Screaming Antelope Lvl 2 Showdown||

Man, what a stacked terrain spread. Our random terrain is the Nightmare Tree and Tall Grass, and the special rules give us a Flower Patch terrain card as well, for a total of 2 flower patches, 6 acanthus, a bug patch, and a nightmare tree to gather at. Busy Showdown ahead. Alright, long positioning details incoming.


Nightmare Tree: [5-7,10-12]

Tall Grass: [3-4,8-9] and [8-9,8-9]

Flower Patch: [2,9] and [2,7]

Acanthus Plant: [7,8] [7,9] [8,7] [8,10] [9,7] [9,10] 


beegoo: [1,7]

Blueborn: [1,8]

Misfortune: [1,10]

Leer: [1,3]


On arrival, Red fist provides 1 Strength token, and Song of the Brave removes a -1 Strength token from all survivors, so everyone goes net +2. Blueborn's Stone Noses and Screaming Braces net him a total of 1 survival (already capped) and 4 insanity, as well. Lastly, an Evasion token from the Flower Knight Badge.

Finally, we begin.


Round 1 [beegoo MC]:

AI Draw: Infested. Lol, annoying first card. Genuinely probably the absolute worst possible draw, and there's no way to remove it. Oh well.

beegoo and Misfortune take 2 brain damage (of course to two survivors who are the shortest on insanity...) 

Misfortune takes a brain trauma: Danger Seizure. 1 Body damage (Heavy injury knockdown) and gains Narcissistic. At least they don't have any head armor on, I suppose, but no + insanity means they're just as vulnerable to tramas as they were a moment ago. I'd kill for Accept Darkness.

Second AI Draw: Stomp [No Target]

The Antelope Grazes, moving to [10-11,7-8] W facing and archives an Acanthus Plant.

Diabolical [Blueborn]

Furry Throat wound attempt: Natural 7 (Critical Wound!)

Gain 1 Screaming Antelope Resource [Shank Bone] and roll 1d10 [6]. The antelope does not die instantly.

We'll use Whip Specialization to Wound off Stomp instead of the top of the AI deck.

Restless Back wound attempt: Natural 8 (Critical Wound)

Restless Chest wound attempt: Natural 8 (Critical Wound)
