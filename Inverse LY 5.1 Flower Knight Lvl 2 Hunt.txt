||LY 5 Flower Knight Lvl 2 Hunt||


I'm very excited. This should be immensely fruitful. Fingers crossed nothing unexpectedly turns for the worst. This is also our inaugural Level 2! How wonderful, and also quite early. Thank you Flower Knight.

Thanks to Baby and the Sword, Harvester is about 10x as likely as normal, which is fun.


Random Hunt Event [Beegoo] - Fated this year, 86: Putrid Tunnels

Everyone rolls 1d10

beegoo: 1 > 10, converted thanks to the special rules for the year

Blueborn: 9

Misfortune:4

Leer: 4

beego and Blueborn contract Leprosy. Dangerous to have, but a powerful tool. Hopefully we don't see Exterminate turn 1 this showdown.

Random Hunt Event [Blueborn] - 42: Surgeon

We have no impairments, but Blueborn has a pesky Shattered Jaw that could use repair. Why not.

Their Shattered Jaw is cured, but they gain Fear of the Dark. Annoying. I suppose we'll need to prioritize the Barber Surgeon soon.

Random Hunt Event [Misfortune] - 76: Dream the Way

Our rolls are 2, 2, 4 8. Blueborn and beegoo gain 1 insanity.

Random Hunt Event [Leer] - 02: Corpse

Everyone loses 2 survival, but we gain 1 random Basic Resource thanks to Cannibalize [Broken Lantern]. Nice!

The Forest Wants What it Wants:

Our initial roll is 9. Awesome! I'll give a -1 Strength token to every survivor to bump that up to 13. Everyone gains 5 insanity and 1 understanding. beegoo does not gain understanding because she is Codependent.

Flower Knight Hunt Event [beegoo]: Pool of Secrets

We have nothing to gain from this, so we'll ignore it completely.

Flower Knight Hunt Event [Blueborn]: Choking Heat

beegoo and Blueborn must roll: 5, 1

They both lose Half of their Body armor, 1 and 2 respectively.

The hunt has worn down our resources meaningfully, but I think we'll be fine. We've arrived at the Flower Knight
