||LY 20 - Red Witch Trials Witnessed||


We've got a bit of a doozy of a year ahead. We have 7 endeavors going into it. Here goes!


Random Settlement Event - Nickname. Cute! 

TL;DR, no stat losses, Leer gains 1 Str and Spd, Flit  gains 1 Acc. Thanks Otherworldly Luck!


Next, we are Watched! We respond Romantically, gaining Final Fighting Art and I nominate Easter to roll on the table.

Roll result: 2>8 (using their reroll)

They gain 1 Str, 10 insanity, and Immortal. I'll take it.


Now for the really scary part. The Red Witch Trials.

Trial Count: 4 + 2 (We have technically killed 1 white speaker, unfortunately.)

6 total! That's not too bad, half as many as we could have had. Let us begin. I've made a wheel of our 23 luck survivors in order to properly randomly select one.

Our first lucky interrogee is Value! Someone I don't particularly care about, great.

Trial 1: Waist (Hyperalgesia and a broken Hip)

Trial 2: Head. Braal kills them. We gain a Monster Organ from Cannibalize

Our next lucky winner is Trial, The Bright Side! Apt.

Trial 3: Body. Another Broken Hip and Hyperalgesia

Trial 4: Legs. Hamstrung, ouch.

Trial 5: Body. Dead. We gain ???.

Our final trial-haver is Out. A nobody without even a Character card. No problem, I don't mind if they get a little maimed.

Trial 6: Head. Hyperalgesia and a Broken Hip. Not like I was bringing them out anyway, probably.

We are declared Innocent! Out is pissed, gaining 2 Str and Rageholic. Still not taking them out lmao.


Time for a prosperous Black Harvest!!

I nominate Bounty to harvest the Vampiric Artichoke: 7. The plant eats them! We gain a Monster Hide to storage, and gain a LOAD of benefits, including allowing us to skip the Gilled Fungus requirement on the Greatleg de Granuille Cooking recipe. We've definitely got to take advantage of that this year. So many things to spend endeavors on...

In the meantime, we Unbury our beautiful Calcified Shoulder Pads using a Scell to guarantee our success. Out will do the honors, and they gain Freeclimber in the process.


Unfortunately, we lost our Secretive survivor and were not able to replace them, so our Secret Meeting chain ends here. Alas, no Old Master for me, nor Beetle Strength and all of that. But that's okay! You can't have it all all the time.


Finally, we reach the develop step relatively unscathed! Morgue next us 2 Monster Hide.


Let's go ahead and Innovate: Petal Spiral, Memento Mori, Scrap Smelting, and Shrine. I'll take Shrine, as that leads to Sacrifice which could net us the Strain Fighting Art we have our eye on this campaign.

Just because it's fun and novel, let's cook up the Greatleg meal! We'll give the +2 Movement to Stew, as that'll be nice to pass on with their Sleeping Virus Flower.

We'll craft up an easy Calcified Greaves and Scarab Circlet while we have the Black Harvest benefits ongoing. I'm tempted to make another set of Shoulderpads, but that would require I send another endeavor to Leathermaking, and I've only got 5 left right now... We'll see where we're at later this year. 1 is already reserved for starting a new Black Harvest, and I'd like to spare some for giving people Evasion via bloodletting. I also need to consider setting up new synchros potentially, and getting Otherworldly luck on some new people. I really just can't do everything I'd like to this year, so some of it will need to be put off. Gosh, and Nightmare training too! The ergophobia we got was evil, especially after we got Post Traumatic Stress on Stew last year. Game's really eating into my Endeavor stores.

I'd like to take Flit out more, but with Ergophobia it's just a complete no-go because we need so many endeavors so badly right now. It's okay, they're well statted and we can bring them out to stuff like Pariah or Seer, potentially. They'll do well there, I think.

I also want to leave Leer at home and set them up to be the forward B&R survivor for Trick Transport in the future, which would allow us to hold them at max hunt xp without retiring indefinitely, since they get sent home before gaining hunt xp when they trick transport with the other B&R survivor, which is excellent. Unfortunately, that means we can't use them anymore until we get Trick Transport and our second Black and Red set.

Okay, I think I'm seeing the plan:

1 endeavor to Black Harvest

1-2 endeavors to get Otherworldly Luck on a new survivor to take Leer's place in the hunt this year

1 endeavor (if left over from the above) to make leather and get another Shoulder Pad to calcify

2 endeavors to give survivors EVA via the special Bloodletting effect from Nico this year. Namely, Stew and Blueborn, since Stew can pass the stats on for extra value and Blueborn is reaching statistical critical mass.

I'll sleep on this and see if anything else comes to mind as pressing. We're hunting DBK 2 one more time this year, I suspect. Hopefully we get the Underplate Fungus and can never hunt it again.


Alright, I'm starting with Otherworldly Luck. I have Fear, The Sword who already has Unconscious Fighter- I think I can just barely compress Lure Lantern on to them as well to not need 2 new Otherworldly Luck survivors this year.


Fear Sculpture: 5. We'll use one of our settlement's now relatively plentiful rerolls on this.

Reroll: 10! we go it. Nice. That covers us on our mission critical hunt gear, but we're sacrificing a second weapon. I might try to fit something in on our Rawhide survivor if I can. I think I will otherwise follow through on the prior gameplan.

Stew Bloodletting: 4. +1 permanent evasion, +3 insanity.

Blueborn Bloodletting: 6. Same as above.

2 endeavors left. Leathermaking for 6 leather using 1 ??? and 5 monster hides

We craft another Century Shoulder Pad. I could craft a second but we don't have enough to calcify 4 items this year, only 3 so a second copy will have to suffice for now.


Last endeavor, Black Harvest! I nominate 3 survivors for it. If they die I wouldn't mind, and I'll use a reroll to try and make it happen:

Result: 3+3. 6! They die and nourish the field! We add a Monster Bone, Hide, and Organ to settlement storage.

Now the embalmers- I need 3. I'll nominate 3 new survivors, Ace, Isle, and Free in the pursuit of triggering Tinker a couple times.

Our results are 6, 5, 7. They each successfully embalm the gear with no complications and gain 1 understanding, so we get 3 Tinker procs. Exciting! Additionally, our Digging Claws, Century Shoulder Pads, and Century Greaves are all buried in the ground to be recovered LY 24.

Our tinker results are 7, 6, 2. Essentially, two more endeavors! Awesome! I had not planned for this, but it opens up a lot of great opportunities. Two things call out to me primarily in this moment. Bloodletting a couple more people for EVA, which would be great but not *that* important in the grand scheme, or potentially taking a couple swings at Nightmare training to get us to Whip and the border of Bow mastery, the latter of which being a much bigger deal, obviously. I think I'll go for the latter. Nightmare Training with Blueborn (Otherworldly Luck) first.


Blueborn Nightmare Training: 8, instant weapon prof! Nice. They're 1 away from Bow mastery, but it's not a big deal I get it this second since it's not extremely relevant for the Vespertine bow.

Stew Nightmare Training: A LOT of rolls, the specifics of which do not matter much. We spent a total of 12 survival, a Crab Spider, and TWO settlement rerolls to ward off 1's, and just got double 1'd in the end anyway. No Whip mastery for us right now. That's okay! Very expensive failure, but worth a try. 

We'll be leaving the Worn Brawling Bow at home this year. We shouldn't need it, and I'd rather not randomly lose it if I can help it. Black Harvest nets us an extra 1 armor across the board and capped survival on all of our departing survivors this year! Off to hunt another DBK2.
