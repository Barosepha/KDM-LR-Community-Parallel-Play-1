||LY 18 - Nothing Special||

We come back with 5 Endeavors and have preparation and consideration to do for the coming couple Lantern Years. But first:

Random SE: Startling Barks. Damn, this is going to suck a lot. We randomly nominate Rose to roll on the event.

Roll result: -3. Ouch. Rose dies and we witness an Omen. It's okay, though. We actually wanted the holder of the Sword of Silence to die right about now anyway in order to improve the outcome of Nico's arrival. Another Monster Organ to Storage.

We Innovate: Records, Hovel, Scarification, Petal Spiral. Thanks for showing up, Scarification! We'll take you.

Let's light a bunch of Hide on fire to make the Count set!

We make a quick 5 Leather with an endeavor and craft the whole thing, only using a couple awkward items.

I spend an endeavor and a Dried Acanthus on the special rules for the year on Blueborn. Unfortunately they roll 4, so I use their lifetime reroll before they gain the new one in order to reroll into a 10! Binge Eating + a fresh Lifetime reroll, gladly.

The challenge at hand is using these last 2 endeavors and the stronger specimens in our settlement to prepare to cut down a Dung Beetle Knight level 2 this year.

Think I'll just put Synchro on Beegoo and Leer and call it good. Leer's str is very slightly lacking for the fight, but I think katar spec and what have you should cover for the weakness, and they're VERY durable to attack profiles which is what we want, but I'd also really like to have Otherworldly Luck on our Copper gatherer. I guess, fortunately (in a way) the person occupying that slot also has anhedonia because I want to bring out a sufficiently insane survivor to be able to use frogdoggles, so we at least have a chance of digging the trap out of the deck before it ruins our day and sniping it with Vespertine Bow. 2 Synchros it is.

Holy shit I just remembered I have Character... Well, that's a lot of bookkeeping to run through real quick lol. 

Looks like we got it LY 16 and then had 4 kids LY 17. Thank goodness, less than I was worried about. Time to build a Character deck.

For our 4 impairments, I'll go with Lonely, Clumsy, Hunger, and Dying. Dying getting us a murder could be a great help to many of our goals. I won't go through an exhaustive list of our Abilities, but our Legendary options are The Fang, Weapon Master, and Dream of the Heart. I think I'll go with Dream of the Heart because having a unique savior could be fun. Not like I expect to get many in a SotF campaign, even with our Otherworldly Luck fuckery. Glow is also out and about, but I think it's a bit late to consider her stuff, unfortunately. We get The Gatherer, The Parent, The Bright Side, and The Adventurer. Nothing insane, but nice stuff. Bold trigger didn't get anything of note, but it is a Matchmaker we might use later! Good stuff. 

Okay, now we depart.
