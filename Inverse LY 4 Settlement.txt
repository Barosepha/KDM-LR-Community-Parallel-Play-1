||LY 4 Settlement Phase - Pariah||

Before anything else happens, 2 survivors are selected:

Our fresh faced newbie Swindle had the (mis)fortune of taking the most damage this past hunt and showdown (A grand total of 2 out of the total 3 points of damage we withstood this year) and is selected by the Pariah to remain un-healed, be forced to depart, gain 'Unbound Range' and has a Shank Bone stolen from her.

beegoo is chosen as the recipient of the Pariah's affection in the next instant, gaining Codependent, Skipping the Pariah showdown, and receiving a perishable Bladder as a gift. What a perfect gift to help us make some Blood Paint. :)

Back to our regularly scheduled programming, a random settlement event: Rivalry. Bothersome, but should be fine.

Our Rivals are Doug and Swindle, their collective roll roll result is 4. Rivalry on the Timeline next year and one of them [Swindle] gains a Gaping Chest Wound. I want to roll on the event to remove Rivalry from next year but yeesh. Sucks to very likely lose a survivor and potentially have it be Doug. I think the upside is good enough, but it also sucks to be taxed 2 of our endeavors as well. No Synchro pairs this year.

2 Endeavors to roll on Rivalry: 7. Tempting to reroll to try and save a life and maybe get Partnership for free. 30% odds and 20% to kill both of them. Unfortunately I can't do the roll-off to determine which of them will die before I do this, since I would choose to save Doug but not Swindle. I think I'll use Swindle's reroll to take the shot at this: LANTERN 10! You love to see it. Everyone lives! Doug and Swindle fight for hours and begrudgingly respect one another. We innovate Partnership for free, they become Partners, and Rivalry is removed from the timeline next year.

Our third endeavor plus a Monster Bone, Fiddler Crab Spider, and Muscly Gums will go toward an Innovation: Forbidden Dance or Pictograph.

Pretty easy Forbidden Dance pick for me. Even with the additional consequence in Petal Spiral, it's just great to see for our Synchro Strikes and the potential for Heart Flute in the future. 10 thick innovation deck with no symposium is a bit of a pain, but I'll live.

Our second difficult call this year is deciding what to do with our resources. We're going into a Nemesis year, which means if we don't bank adequate stuff we don't get to innovate next year, which is a little lame. We've got lots of good stuff I'd like to spend our resources on, but I've only got bones and love juice banked, which means we need to save a Hide if we don't want to utilize our Perfect Hide for an innovation next year, which we don't. The long and short is that we will not be making 1 piece of Screaming armor instead of 2, and need to use a Love Juice next year for the innovation which isn't too big of a deal.

Bladder + Screaming Brain: Blood Paint
Pelt + Monster Hide: Screaming Bracers

We lend a name to a brand new survivor, Leer, who will be joining Lawrence, Swindle, and against my prior planning, Doug into battle against the Pariah. I'm taking Doug, our valuable F&T candidate to this engagement because he is simultaneously the best shot we've got at killing the Pariah and also allows us to leverage Partnership between him and Swindle to cap out both of their Survival Limits, which nets us a total of 4 extra survival compared to where we otherwise would be. Lawrence has eproctophilia but Swindle is using the Long club, so we'll be giving her the Monster Grease. The Blood Paint is going to our Grappleclaw grid with the Spiked Buckler to take advantage of perma-blocking. Hopefully it will serve us well. Our last endeavor could go to a Matchmaker intimacy, but I haven't got Face Paint or anything and a Synchro user to replace beegoo in this fight and give us just an ounce better odds against Pariah seems like a wise addition, so that Synchro user shall be Leer.

We depart to fight Pariah. Our Departure also gains us 2 new people hitting Insight. Doug gains Tinker and 1 accuracy (2 permanent accuracy now! Would be tragic for him to get bricked by the Pariah) and Lawrence gains literally nothing of value as she rolled an endeavor which is lost as we leave, and can't gain Tinker because of her Anhedonia.
