||LY 18 Dung Beetle Knight Lvl 2 Hunt||


Noodling of Death! Pull off the bandaid!: 3. I was afraid of this exact thing happening. Fuck it. I have one reroll in the party, we'll use it. Pray for me.

Reroll: 5. A Vermin. Better than the lantern loss at least. We're running short on time to finish up our copper reserves. We gain a Sword Beetle.


Root Basic HE: 95. Fortunately, everyone's wearing armor everywhere this hunt, so I am unaffected.


Leer Basic HE: 9, Golden Light. Leer must Investigate and gain 1 Courage. 5. They suffer 2 event damage to the Head. Slightly annoying for Heartwyrm tunnel reasons.


Blueborn DBK HE: Rolling Fertilizer. Ugh, +1 damage token sucks. Whatever, though. I need to save the special rules for the year for a scarier hunt event.

Consequential Random HE: 72. Something to Pass the Time. We have +4 to our result thanks to Song of the Brave.

Result: 11! Everyone rolls a d10 for a coin flip's chance to gain survival or cure a disorder

Root: 6. We cure Anhedonia.

Leer: 8. We cure Seizures.

Blueborn: 2

Stew: 10. We cure indecision. 

Great stuff!


Stew DBK HE: Bug Man. We roll a d10 aiming for under our courage (6) - 2! Nice. Now we roll on the table: 8. +1 Courage and Understanding. Sure, close to See the Truth pretty soon.


Root Basic HE: 45! Real shame we didn't take out a pickaxe, but at least we have bandaids to avoid the catastrophic bleed. Everyone takes 1 Body damage.

Overwhelming Darkness:

Root: 4. -1 eva token and everyone else gains 1 survival.

Leer: 2

Blueborn: 3

Stew: 3

the 3 above gain -1 acc token. Nbd!


Herb Gathering!:

Root: 2, 6, 9 (17)

Leer: 3, 9, 8 (20)

Blueborn: 10, 2, 1 (13)

Could enter the swamp here potentially. Not sure I want to do that.

Stew rolls 0 dice.

Everyone gains 4 total survival from the event, we get a vermin and 2 fresh acanthus.

Crab Spider, cool.


Red Incursion time! I forgot all along that I had Otherworldly Luck on Leer and Blueborn, which could have maybe helped with some things, but it WILL help with this!

Initial roll: 9 on the die + 3 from the armor +1 from otherworldly luck holy shit we're going into the Seer's Chambers! With no reroll! Pray for me, this could be CATASTROPHIC.

Seer's Chamber - Our highest affinity count is far and away green, so we roll for Worn Brawling Bow: 5. No special ability, but we get the bow! Amazing. You have served me well, Beast Knuckle, but a bigger, better Katar has come. Shame I can't activate the affinity ability, but it's fine. This is a 7 str bump effectively, among other upsides. Absolutely amazing pull for our future, so long as we can protect it jealously.


Root DBK HE- Practice Dummies. Sure!: 6. +1 Understanding. Okay! Showdown time!!!
