||LY 5 - Hands of Heat||

6 endeavors, 1 Burnished Encephalomatter, and 2 newly dead survivors including the strongest of us to a freak accident. So it goes.

First up, Settlement Event: Murder. Lmao. Lawrence is murdered and Shoeborn is slain in exchange. We lack a Mere Navi now but I'd prefer that to losing Blueborn, our equally most insane survivor to his sister.

Cannibalize adds a Monster Bone and Perfect bone to our Settlement Storage.

Incidentally, this has brought us to exactly 5 population, triggering the Parallel Play's special 'Armored Strangers' milestone. We'll need to do that later once we reach that point of the settlement phase.

Hands of Heat: We gain Lantern Oven (And Clothed and Satiated, thanks to the special campaign rules implemented this year!.) Finally some Departing Survival.

I nominate beegoo and we roll a 6 on the table, which is the perfect result, thankfully. Lantern Branding would drive me insane. beegoo gains 1 courage, 1 strength, and Red Fist. Delightful.

Next up, A Crone's Tale. I nominate beegoo to gain the Sleeping Virus Flower and Flower Addiction.

Milestones! The newly added Fade pillar triggers, since we got Storytelling for free. I'll have to figure out how to implement it properly later, but it doesn't matter right now. Then, the special Parallel Play Armored Strangers. Yay!

First, we gain the Guidepost innovation. More Departing Survival, I shan't complain. Then, we roll until we see >4.

3, 3, 1, 1, 10. Thanks for the rerolls I suppose. +1 extra departing survival this year and 6 basic resources:

Monster Organ x2
Perfect Organ
Perfect Hide
Perfect Bone
Skull (+1 insanity to Leer)

Crazy. No scrap, but I could never say this wasn't excellent.

Now finally into the 'normal' settlement phase.

Endeavor + Monster Organ, Bone, and Hide makes an innovation: Heart Flute and Pictograph. Ezpz, Heart Flute. I couldn't ask for anything more than full power Synchro so early. 12 thick innovation deck is stressful but at least we have that.

Since we've only got the 5 survivors, I may as well name the last two that lack names. Fortune and Misfortune. Fortune currently lacks her Lifetime Reroll.

We're obligated to endeavor at Storytelling this year (For free! How nice) so we shall right now. Blueborn will do it.

Storytelling: 3, +1 understanding, triggering Insight and making him a Tinker. He rolls 4 on that, giving us an extra endeavor. Back to 6. 

2/5 survivors currently have Synchronized strike. 3 endeavors: now all of them have it. Best to get investment out of the way when we have an excess.

It may seem silly to Harvest Ritual with all 3 Perfect Resources already currently drawn, but honestly I mostly want extra Hides and maybe a little scrap right now, so I think it's what I'm going to do.

1 endeavor + 2x Shank Bone and Mossy Molar for 3 Basic Resources:

Monster Hide x2
???

No scrap, but nice regardless.

Pelt + Monster Hide: Screaming Leg warmers

Monster Hide: Bandages

Our last couple endeavors will go to Drums. 2 insanity for Blueborn to get them to active Frogdoggles, and Rhythm Chaser for beegoo.

Our departing survivors get a fat stack of Survival and 1 understanding, making Leer a newly minted Tinker.

Our bank is getting stuffed with good stuff, including a comfortable trove of Perfect resources. Bodes well for constructing a Black Knight set later, I suppose.

I think, with the confluence of circumstances including Red Fist and C&S, I will be hunting a level 2 Flower Knight as opposed to a level 1 this year. Should be quite profitable and effective for us. We'll see how next week's special rules look before I commit for sure, but I feel good about it.
