Movement to [12,11]

Activate Grappleclaw (Synchro Strike active)

Attack rolls: 3 > 4, 6, 6 (2 hits)

Trap! Second hit location card this time :))

beegoo and Leer suffer 2 brain damage. This triggers a Brain Trauma for beegoo. Shame we haven't had the population to Accept Darkness.

Brain Truama: 3, Memory Loss again. I guess Whip mastery is just a lost cause at this point, she's lost 4 points of it over 2 memory losses down to one. Oh well, not like it would have really come up for any other weapons in the future. Just means the Grappleclaw doesn't benefit from any extra longevity this campaign, more than likely. This also does not provide any more insanity, so next brain damage is another trauma, Yay!!

Basic action [beegoo]

Attack rolls: 3, 5, 7, 10 (2 hits, Leg and Body)

2 each, Body heavy injury knocking beegoo down and 1 Body severe injury because we took 3 Body damage coming into this showdown on the hunt: 5

Destroyed back, beegoo can no longer activate the Grappleclaw. As much as I hate to lose population, I guess it's time for her to die when it's next convenient, because her usefulness has plummeted in the last year or so.

The Bleed gain from the severe injury triggers Blueborn's new Hemophobiam knocking him down.

Gaseous Bloat. 3 cards on the stack now :)
