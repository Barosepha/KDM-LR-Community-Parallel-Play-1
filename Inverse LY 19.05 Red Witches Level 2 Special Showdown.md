||LY 19 Red Witches Level 2 Special Showdown||


No timer to worry about this time. In my heart of hearts I think they're fucked here. Our aim will be to turn Nico to dust instantaneously.

Normal arrival token stuff with red fist and what have you. Our tactic is Attack Pattern, which is alright but likely inconsequential.


Round 1 [Root MC]

We are defending our home. We go first.

Survivors' Turn:

Blueborn acts

Movement away from the pack for Reaction reasons

Vespertine Bow: 8, 10, 3>1 (2 hits.)

Mentor's Departure (No critical wound effect): Natural 1. Rought start (Failure)

Red Initiate spawns next to Blueborn

Nico swaps with Braal

Braal Basic action [Blueborn]

Attack rolls: 2, 4, 5, 1 (0 hits)

Nico is out of range, this attack ends.

Whatever, we'll just kill Braal since she's so kindly in Synchro position now.

Act ends

Stew acts

Movement into Blind Spot + Synchro

Grappleclaw: 9, 8, 4 (3 hits.)

Trap. Man we're off to a great start.

This attack is wasted, people are knocked around, bleed tokens happen, etc. Yeesh.

Root acts

Frogdoggles (Braal): Meteoric Brawny Trunk, Meteoric Bellow. Scary AI Card.

Rawhide Headband (Nico): Cruel Bloodpresence and Horrifying Shot. The first is a TON of red thread if I clean up the initiates in time, admittedly. Double checking the deck, there's only the one to gain. Normal AI card it is, then.

Surge Headband (Braal): Meteoric Bellow, Meteoric Menace. Menace is much more manageable.

Root Encourages Stew

Stew Dash + Surge on the red initiate
