||LY 1 Frogdog Lvl 1 Hunt||

beegoo, Blueborn, Shoeborn, and Doug set out on our first proper hunt.


Basic Hunt Event[82, Blueborn ER (Event Revealer)]: Consuming Grass. Rough start, but at least we have +2 thanks to this year's special flourishing nature! First we have to determine a straggler.

(6, 4, 9, 4)

Both Bluebown and Doug are stragglers, very annoying. However! We also have a Whip on this hunt thanks to the Grappleclaw on beegoo, meaning our stragglers have a total of +6(!) to the roll.

Blueborn rolls a 9 for a total result of 15, and Doug rolls a 10 for a total result of 16, stopping their falls before it's too late. Fortunate. Hopefully this persists as we proceed.


Frogdog Hunt Event [Euphony, Shoeborn ER]:


No instruments on us this year, so unfortunately Shoeborn is getting zapped for 1d10 (3) brain damage, filling their brain injury box.


Basic Hunt Event [47, Doug ER]:


Another plant based hunt event! Lucky me, in a way. Less fortunate that they're unambiguously bad events for me. We haven't got a sickle, so immediately we wipe out our single points of survival on Blueborn, Shoeborn, and Doug. beegoo is also currently insane, so she'll need to roll on the event with +2 from nature's flourishing. 2 on the die for 4 total which forces a reroll, -1 survival, and 2 event damage to a random hit location [Arms] and then a 7 on the die to get out of the event.

We're walking into this Frogdog with 0 survival across the board, an arm heavy injury on beegoo, and a filled brain injury box on Shoeborn. Tough stuff that doesn't bode incredibly well for our first 'full' frogdog, but I've seen worse hunt phases.

We Arrive!
