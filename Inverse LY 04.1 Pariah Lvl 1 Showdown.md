||LY 5 Pariah Lvl 1 Showdown||

Full disclosure, I am quite intimidated. This is a difficult and sporadic looking fight that I have no practical experience with. We'll see how it goes.

Our random terrain is quite fortunate. A Mammoth Leaf [8-10,1-3) and a Copperfish Den [13,6]

Starting Positions:

Lawrence [8,1]

Swindle [9,1]

Doug [10,1]

Leer [13,1]

Pariah moves to [9-10,7-8] S facing

Attack rolls: 8, 9 (2 hits, Waist and Head)

This will be FOUR damage lmao. It's a severe either way, so Swindle will Dodge the Head hit.

Sever Waist Injury: 4, Intestinal Prolapse. Sucks but not a huge deal.

Survivors' Turn:

Doug acts

Leer dashes to [10,6]

Wicked Cape Collar wound attempt: Natural 9! (Critical Wound!)

All survivors gain 1 token on somatic static

Cyclopean Empathy: Reciprocal Rage. I guess we'll Somatic Static this, I don't want to be Frenzied this early. We've seen 2 A cards already so it's pretty unlikely there's many devastating Cyclopean Empathies left in the deck right now.

Bloodstained Bicep wound attempt: 8 (Failure)

Pariah skitters to [13-14,8-9] E facing

Act ends

Pariah moves to [12-13,7-8]

Attack rolls: 10, 10 (2 hits, obviously. Legs, Head)

We dodge the head hit, get knocked down by 2 to the legs and gain a somatic static token

Malingering Knuckles wound attempt: 11 (Wound)

Cyclopean Empathy: Long-Reach Yank, can't activate Reach of Ranged weapons for the rest of the showdown. All good.

Malingering Digits wound attempt: 12 (Wound)

Movement to [14,7]

Beast Knuckles

Attack rolls (Synchro strike active): 4, 8 (2 hits)

Trap! :/ Worst timeline in some ways. 3 revealed somatic empathy cards AND a basic action.

Frenzy with no tokens (ugh) -1 movement token, 1 body damage past armor

Pariah faces E

Basic action attack rolls: 8, 8 (2 hits, Body x2) 

Pariah can't miss and apparently he has just decided to cause a body severe injury today. Yippee!!

Body severe injury roll: 2

Genuinely, fuck off. Alas, there's absolutely nothing that can be done about any of this chain of events because we're doomed. Awesome stuff. Don't fear the trap guys, it's not a problem, it'll just straight kill your most important survivor out of nowhere sometimes with no recompense. So it goes, we must forge on. Doug is dead.

We add a Perfect Organ to the Settlement Storage, and Swindle loses the Partner - Doug ability and gains Anhedonia.

This has broken about as bad as it possibly could have, genuinely a statistical marvel.

Poor Swindle.

Attack rolls: 2, 9 (1 hit, Arms)

Incredible! It CAN miss! 

2 Arms damage, 2 bleed, Bash, 1 Somatic Static token

Survivors' Turn:

Our wounding ability has been cut by ~ 70% with the loss of doug to about .2% odds, which is nice. We should hopefully still pull through.

Attack rolls: 7, 5 (2 hits, Malingering Forearm and Rubicon Steel Heel)

Malingering Forearm wound attempt: 9! Very cool! 80% chance to wound and we rolled a 2! Things are going well. This is normally ill-advised but I'm using a Lifetime Reroll here. Why not. 13! Much more acceptable. (Wound)

Cyclopean Empathy: Covetous Frenzy, 1 head damage that ignores armor. We'll somatic it I suppose. I'd at least like a shot at wounding this Parry hit location (Cool that we drew it in our mammoth leaf Leap attack! All the strength is getting put to great use right now.)

Rubicon Steel Heel wound attempt: Lantern 10. Thank you fortune for shifting a little bit. (Critical Wound)

Leer gains 3 survival.

Cyclopean Empathy: Lashing Curses, gain Coprolalia and -1 evasion token. Sucks but whatever, nothing we can do.

Additional Aftermath bits for this event! We don't gain death principle benefits, so I suppose I'll remove the Perfect Organ and Monster Hide we got earlier. No problem. Lawrence and Leer roll a 6 and 5 respectively, each gaining 1 Strength. Plus, we gain Storytelling for free! Good stuff.

See you in the settlement phase.
