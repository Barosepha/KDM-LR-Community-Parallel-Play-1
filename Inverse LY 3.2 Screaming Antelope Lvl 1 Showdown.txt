Skull
Monster Bone

Not quite as intensely lucrative as the last, but a very solid distribution. No scrap or Spiral horn means we can't complete a Screaming Antelope set this year without using our Burnished Encephalomatter, which I will not be doing. Maybe we'll be able to find a scrap during the settlement phase. We also got no bladder again, which I may be able to fix this upcoming Settlement Phase :) We also successfully left Swindle as the most injured of us for the upcoming Special Event, which is perfect. Homeward Bound.
