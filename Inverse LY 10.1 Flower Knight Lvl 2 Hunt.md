||LY 10 Flower Knight Lvl 2 Hunt||


Now that we're in the double digit year range, I'm going to cut down to a little more shorthand just for my typing simplicity.


Buddy Basic: 62, Space Between the Rocks. +1 Iron 


Vine Basic: 54, Bone Storm. We have no fragile gear and loads of armor, I think I'll just take the courage and damage here. 3 hit location rolls for each survivor:

Buddy: 3x Body

Vine: 2x Leg, 1x Arms

Drifter: Legs, Waist, Body

Sprout: Head, 2x Body


Drifter Basic: 15, Man Trap (I swear to god.) Roll result: 7, 1 Legs damage


Sprout Basic: 15 again, amusingly. Roll result: 6. Destroy all legs armor and then take 1 legs damage. Annoying for the Frogdog gear but fixable.


The Forest Wants What it Wants: 5

I want to avoid taking any excess Bleed here, so ideally I can produce 8 points here. I'll give everyone -1 str token and everyone except Buddy 1 Bleed. Lastly, Drifter will archive Stone noises, bringing our total to 13. Everyone gains 1d5 (2) insanity and 1 Understanding. This causes Vine and Sprout to hit Insight and Drifter to hit his 3 Understanding milestone which gives him 2 Evasion. Vine gains 1 Accuracy, Sprout gets to reroll 1 hunt event result this year, and they both gain Explore.


Buddy FK event: Forest Event Horizon. If we collectively roll 5 or less we wipe: 16. We're good. Now a Basic hunt event.

Buddy Basic: 64, Stone Fountain. Really skirting around 63 today lol. Everyone will consume for the Courage.

Buddy: 10, +1 Survival

Vine: 8, Nothing

Drifter: 8, Nothing

Sprout: 10, +1 Survival


Red Incursion!!!: 2, everyone other than Sprout takes 2 damage to 2 hit locations

Vine: Legs, Arms

Drifter: Head, Legs

Sprout: Body x2

Buddy gains 2 Bleed, +1 Understanding triggering Insight (Explore and 1 hunt event result reroll) and may roll again on this table with +2: 4. Jesus. I'm going to use Sprout's reroll here just because I want to get into the mines if I can. 4 AGAIN!!! That's 3 2's on the dice in a row, denying my access to the mines. Vine takes 1d5 (2) Arms damage, everyone other than Buddy gains Secretive, and Buddy gains a third Bleeding token.

Mineral Gathering: Vine rolls a 6, +1 Iron and rolls 7, snapping our second Pickaxe. Geeze.

Herb Gathering: Everyone gains 1 Survival to start

Buddy: 3, 7, 6 (16)

Vine: 4, 2, 8 (14)

Drifter: 8, 4 (12)

Sprout will abstain from rolling. 

Our collective total is 52, +2 Fresh Acanthus, 1 Vermin [Crab Spider], and everyone gains 3 survival. I'll give the Fresh Acanthus to Vine and Drifter.

Almost forgot Noodling of Death!: 7. Ah, I should have remembered to do this prior to Red Incursion to make our ordering a little more precise here. Oh well, my mistake and a bit to complicated to fix now. Buddy bleeds to death, but does snatch us 1 Burnished Encephalomatter on the way out. Cannibalize drops 1 Skull to our Settlement Storage. Shame those bandages don't do anything on the hunt lol. This also means we're without bandages and rawhide headband for this showdown, which is devastating. We may have made a pretty critical error here.


Vine FK Event: Sudden Life. Everyone takes 1 direct Head damage and we plug our ears to avoid the rest of the punishment. 


That brings our total damage taken this year's hunt to a devastating 32. I'm glad we're hunting FK and nothing more usually dangerous. 


Oh hey I totally forgot we got 4 people to 3 Understanding. I'll take those seed patterns at least. Backstabbing Stone, Master Bone Dagger, Cyclops Ledger, and Armorsmith's Tongs. Interesting stuff.
