||LY 7 Screaming Antelope Lvl 2 Hunt||

The object of our hunt are the last pieces we need of the Screaming set. A Spiral Horn and a Pelt. Anything else we get, including some ever-useful Fresh Acanthus, is a great bonus. We're in for a potentially rather long hunt phase.



beegoo - Screaming Antelope Hunt Event: Stampede. I don't value the courage that much and don't want to eat the damage or brain damage this produces, so we let the antelope step back 1. We get punished if the antelope decides to run 3 more spaces back to starvation.



Blueborn - Random Hunt Event: 94, Sickening Mess. Nobody is Squeamish, so everyone steps forward.

Blueborn and Leer are insane, they consume and gain -1 strength tokens, beegoo and Misfortune are not, they investigate.

beegoo: 13, random basic resource [Perfect Organ]

Misfortune: 5, 1 event damage [Waist] and basic resource [Monster Hide]



Misfortune - Screaming Antelope Hunt Event: Skittish. The antelope runs 1 space further, no problem. Does mean we see one more Lope event and may hit starvation there, but we'll see. We also roll a random hunt event here.

Random Hunt Event: 22, Acid Rain. This is what you should be afraid of, always, when making pushes like this. Misfortune is using their Lifetime Reroll to avoid this because 40 damage across my survivors is no bueno. Reroll to 28. Great, Trollbird, I don't even have to look. Because we have insane survivors, we are forced to give up either a Monster Grease or a Brain Mint. Very frustrating, but I'll toss the Brain Mint. What an awful hunt space.



Leer - Random hunt Event: 30, Rotten Faces. Here are everyone's rolls:

beegoo: 10, Random Basic Resource [Skull]

Blueborn: 10, Random Basic Resource [Broken Lantern]

Misfortune: 10 (What the fuck), Random Basic Resource [???}

Leer: 8, nothing happens.

Uh. I'll take that I guess. We'll call it even on the Brain Mint and reroll.



beegoo - Random Hunt Event: 11, Monster Droppings. beegoo will investigate. 9, we may skip the next hunt space (we can't, it's OD.) We'll take a hunt event that gives 1 understanding and nothing else though, honestly.


Overwhelming Darkness! But not, actually, because of this year's special rules. Instead, we stumble upon the Forest Gate, which Wants What it Wants. It forces us to roll a 1, as well. We must go +7 here to push through without hitting Starvation and wasting the year, so we'll be getting an uncomfortable amount of bleed here. Everyone will be taking -1 strength token and everyone except beegoo will be taking 1 bleed token.

This brings us to a total of 8, giving everyone one more bleed token. The gate is defeated for today.


Blueborn - Screaming Antelope Hunt Event: Teething. In short, everyone rolls. 8, 1, 6, 9. Blueborn takes 1 Arms damage and we get 1 Large Flat Tooth. I forgot to mention the skull insanity earlier, both points will be going to beegoo.


Misfortune - Random Hunt Event: 45, Jagged Valley. This is why we bring bandages! If I didn't, I'd have 3 survivors with 4 bleeding tokens and one with 3 going into this showdown. If we didn't reroll earlier, everyone would have taken 2 damage to every hit location as well, we'd have 0 or less armor on every survivor except Blueborn.

Leer - Screaming Antelope Hunt Event: Devoured Grounds. Nothing happens, functionally. We arrive at the antelope a little worse for wear, but not on Starvation, thankfully.
