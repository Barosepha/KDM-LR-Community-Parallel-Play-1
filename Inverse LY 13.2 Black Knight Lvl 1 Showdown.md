Fencing: 6, the last hit is cancelled. Thank fuck.

FIWB. Dash, surge, do it again.

The BK is defeated!

We get a Monster Bone from our Scav Kit.

Very comfortable fight. A couple scares here and there, but broadly kind.

1 Hunt XP and Weapon prof to those applicable.

We get the BK Badge, which I specifically saved a gear grid slot for, and our Bell of Challenge upgrades to Level 2. It's somewhat powerful to have Honorable on a departing survivor now.

On to the Darkened Workshop!

We have +2 to the roll thanks to victorious survivors with appropriate Understanding. The plight of bringing out 2 newbies. 

5 Total. Since the result nearly couldn't be worse, and I've got a couple to play with, I'll use a reroll here.

4 total! It's worse!! Lmao!!! Sort of. I like not getting Aichmophobia, but it wouldn't matter on our F&T survivor, so we end up just getting 2 Broken Lanterns instead of 4 basics. We'll also take 2 of the Count patterns, not that we'll be using them until the next BK fight gives us the rest of the set anyway.

All in all, barely worth the effort of admission! But we got through without issue, so it works out. Homeward bound.
