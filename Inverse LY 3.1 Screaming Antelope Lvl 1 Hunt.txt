||LY 3 Screaming Antelope Level 1 Hunt||

Screaming Antelope Round 2. Last week's special rules could allow me to tote a Love Juice with me to thin the basic resource deck a little bit to hunt for perfects and more Hide or something, but honestly Love Juice long term is one of the things I want to find in the deck in particular, so I don't think it's worthwhile in this case.

This week's special rules means we'll be attempting to make sure that Swindle, our fresh survivor along on this hunt, takes the most damage throughout in order to become the lightning rod of the Pariah's disdain when we return. Against Antelope, so long as I keep it in mind, it ought to be doable to manufacture that situation? Fingers crossed. On to the Hunt proper.

Screaming Antelope Hunt Event [Doug ER]: Vomit Pile. Free stats for anyone without Consumable Gear. Unfortunately, most of our survivors have Consumable Gear. Swindle and Blueborn will be rolling on the event.

Swindle: 2, +1 courage

Blueborn: 4, +1 courage and Dried Acanthus is archived. All good.

Random Hunt Event [Swindle ER]: 99, the Portcullis. What drama. Unfortunately we haven't got a Key, so we roll again instead. 97, Living Stone. We'll Nominate Swindle: 6. The stone giant leads us right to our Quarry. No ambush, but no more hunt events I suppose. Anticlimactic hunt phase, but so it goes.
