||LY 8 Settlement Phase - Grand Arrivals||

We arrive back into the settlement with a bounty of resources, and a skull haunts the settlement. Misfortune covets it, gaining Marrow Hunger, 1 Weapon Proficiency (unlocking F&T Specialization!) 1 strength, and 1 Speed. I will opt not to put Murder on the timeline for next year, as I lack a society principle anyway and like my eldest survivors.


Random Settlement Event: Gathering Emissions.

Our roll result is 1! This would inflict beegoo with a random severe injury, which I would rather avoid. Vine will use her Lifetime Reroll to hopefully rectify the situation: 6. Vine and Sprout both gain 1 Understanding and a random disorder. Vermin Obsession and Indecision, respectively.

Next up, Glowing Crater. Misfortune must be nominated as a consequence of the previous year's parallel play even special rules. They gain Destined, the Destiny Husk, and Acid Palms. This should help them fulfil their role as F&T trainer much more easily in the coming years. We may also now hunt the Dragon King, although I may wait a little while longer on that front.

Lastly for this year, Rumbling in the Dark! I will nominate Misfortune to gain 1 strength and Vermin Obsession. She clearly has a great many fascinations. We also gain Round Stone Training, which ain't half bad. We'll see if I put it to use this campaign.

Now that we're in the settlement phase proper, I'll go ahead and innovate right away with some basic resources we got on the hunt and one of our 9 endeavors.

Saga, Nightmare Training, Hovel, and Ammonia. They're really teasing me with that Saga, it'd be so funny to take, but I have absolutely no other choice but Ammonia here. It's exactly what I need right now so I'm delighted to finally have it. It exclusively adds Bloodletting to the deck since we already have Lantern Oven, so we go net even on deck size, but + a TON on campaign agency now that we can make leather. A sickle and some pickaxes will serve us quite well I think.


With 1 Pelt, Spiral Horn, Broken Lantern, and a Monster Hide from storage, we finally manage to complete the Screaming set. Awesome!

Next, Harvest Ritual away 10 resources (4 shank bones, 2 flowers, 2 beast steaks, 2 Large Flat Teeth) for 10 Basic Resources:

Monster Hide x7!!!!!!!
Perfect Bone
Broken Lantern
Love Juice

Unbelievable, especially going into our first year having Ammonia. We will obviously be using our third endeavor, 3 hide, and 1 organ to open the Leather Worker.

A fourth endeavor opens the Bone Smith

A fifth to convert 2 Pelts, a Crab Spider, and EIGHT monster hide into 11 Leather.

Leather + Perfect Bone makes a First Aid Kit

3x Leather, 2 Monster Bones, and a skull makes a Bone Sickle and 2 Pickaxes. Might make more later but I'm still trying to identify how we'll divvy up our grid space now that we've got so many options.

I'd like to greed even harder than I have been and skip a Leather set to save for future sets, but I'm going to do what I believe is the wise thing and make the set. It's really exceptional into Braal and the Pariah, and it's even serviceable versus the Dung Beetle Knight for eating ball damage.

5 Leather, 1 skull, 2 ???, 1 Broken lantern makes 1 full leather armor set.

Suddenly, now that we've gotten out hands on leather, our gear grids feel much, much tighter. We're getting like 10+ new excellent pieces of gear all at once lol.

Alright, we've got 4 endeavors to work with and loads of prohibitive disorders I'd like to get rid of. First, I want to get rid of Narcissistic on Misfortune since that's a no go with all our nice little armor sets currently available.

Trepanning: 5. Narcissistic is removed from Misfortune.

beegoo Trepanning: 1, intracranial Hemorrhage. Welp, just another thing to fix with trepanning.

Again: 1 again. Brutal.

I'd like to use my last endeavor to give Misfortune Synchro Strike back, but this hemorrhage is basically a bench if we don't clear it up for the moment, which stresses me out. I'll give it one more go, 30% odds.

Last Trepanning: 3, we remove a Eproctophilia from her, at least, which was the original object of the thing. This seems really quite bad, and it is, don't get me wrong. She has red fist, though which can at the very least give an outlet for 1 desperate survival expenditure if needed, and also is carrying the Sleeping Virus Flower. I think I'll still take her out this year, at least, despite my better judgement. We're in a VERY powerful position at the moment, we can afford a little bit of risk.


Alright, I've done some grid shuffling and things are tight but our grids are very, very strong. We'll be sending the same team out again into Frogdog 2 this time. Optimistically we see the right combination of Frogdog resources to complete that armor set for my quest as well, but the real draw is to get the organ required to get the Copper fishing tool that we'll want to put to use going forward to prepare for the Tuskrafter in the later game. Yet more grid tax! But for a good cause.
