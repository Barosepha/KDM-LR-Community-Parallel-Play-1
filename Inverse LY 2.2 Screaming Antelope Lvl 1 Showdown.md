||LY 2 Screaming Antelope Lvl 1 Showdown||

God, what a loaded Showdown Setup. Our random terrain cards are 2 Tall Grass and a Survivor Corpse, in addition to the showdown's native 3 pairs of Acanthus Plants and Bug Spot. This should be a very profitable year, especially considering this year's special Parallel Play modifiers that allow us to gain +2 to our interaction rolls with the Acanthus as long as we spend our Movement first.

I'm not going to think too hard about placements this year, here's the rundown:

Newbody [1,10], Lawrence [1,9], Steeple [1,8], Blueborn [1,3]

Tall Grasses: [1-2,8-9] and [8-9,8-9]

Fresh Acanthus: [7,9], [8,10], [9,10], [7,8], [8,7], [9,7] (This is surrounding the further Tall Grass. Might as well try to make a save base of ops to dig that stuff up.)

Survivor Corpse: [6,4]

And the Bug Patch is at its standard position of [12,3]


Upon our arrival, we get to remove the negative attribute tokens we got from Overwhelming Darkness. We begin.
