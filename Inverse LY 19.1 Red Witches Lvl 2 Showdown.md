||LY 19 Red Witches Lvl 2 Showdown||


TLDR of our year's special rules that are relevant right now, we get some extra strength tokens to play with. Shan't complain!

Our Tactics this showdown are Black Guard Tactics, and Block Formation. Should be useful, and I don't expect to miss the blind spot *too* much this showdown with our current grids and survivors.

Flit's survival this showdown is a little low, 5 as opposed to our cap of 9, but we'll work with it. Shred should cover a good bit of the aggression tax of this showdown from them.

Let's get to it! Nico hopefully goes down first.


Round 1 [Root MC]:

We're defending our home. We go first.

Vespertine bow: 7, 5>6, 9 (3 hits)

Brawling Bow: 2, 9 (1 hit)

Meteoric Jaw (Katar Spec): Natural 10! (Critical Wound!)

Flit gains 1 permanent Str and Courage. This also triggers Bold, which gives Flit Stalwart and +1 Speed.

As this is the first time  Braal has been wounded this round, we deal 2 wounds instead with the Brawling Bow's Affinity ability.

Shred! (Str token) Brawling Bow: 4, 5, 9 (2 hits)

Meteoric Clenched Fist (Katar Spec): 26 (Wound)

Mesmeric Belly (Parry): Natural 6 (Critical Wound)

Nico gains -1 Eva token and Blueborn MUST spend 1 survival to gain 1 permanent evasion because they are a Binge Eater

Mesmeric Shoulders (Blueborn loses 2 survival): 17 (Wound)

Nico steps away and shoots Cruel Rain into the void, hitting nobody

This distance cancels our attack, allowing us to avoid Alluring Departure. Great!

Act ends

Root acts

Frogdoggles trigger (Braal): Meteoric Menace, Meteoric Brawny Trunk

Rawhide Headband (Nico): Horrifying Shot, Speakerslayer Arrow (Why couldn't it be the other Legendary!?). We'll leave Horrifying Shot on top.

Nico steps back to her range

Attack rolls: 9, 9, 9, 7. Christ. (3 hits)

Fencing: 9 (1 hit cancelled)

B&R armor cancels another hit with the -1 acc token it gave Leer at the end of their turn

We'll Dodge the last hit, wherever it's supposed to be going.

Fencing: 3

2 damage to the Waist, Legs, and Arms. We ignore Bash both with our Leather armor and Iron Will

Our attack continues, as Nico remains within range!

Mesmeric Waist (Parry): Natural 4 (Critical Wound)

Blueborn will erase all of their understanding! This saves us from the Dark Secret conundrum. Incredible.

Frogdoggles activate (Nico): Strafing Bow. A parry. We'll wait to kill her with Blueborn on a flow next round, I guess.

Movement adjacent to both Braal and Nico for cloak reasons

Worn Brawling Bow (Braal): 9, 8, 7 (3 hits)

Meteoric Brawny Trunk (Hyperaemic Armor): 20 (Wound)

Meteoric Red Cloak (Impervious): No point, we'll take the cancel here.

Braal being knocked down unfortunately means we can't Shred on her with the Brawling Bow. Oh well, I've no need to rush.

Survivors' Turn:

Flit acts

Worn Brawling Bow: 5, 7, 8 (3 hits)

Act ends

Blueborn acts

Vespertine Bow: 3>6, 7, 10 (3 hits)

Meteoric Thigh Belt (Hyperaemic armor): Natural 2. (Failure) 

Unfortunately not a crit this time lmao. Missed out on a Speaker Cult Knife for funsies. Oh well!

Meteoric Armlet: Natural 8 (Critical Wound)

Everyone gains 3 survival (Blueborn gains 1 more from Thrill Seeker)

Meteoric Quad: 18 (Wound)

Braal goes down! Second victory against red witches level 2 in the books.


Our special rules modify the Weapon Proficiency from this fight to include Monster Level Bow, Dagger, F&T, or Katar, and we will greedily take all of those Bow proficiency levels for Blueborn and Flit. And 1 Hunt XP for everyone, of course.

Leer reaches Age 4, gaining 1 Luck and becoming 1 hunt away from retirement. They might now have the luxury, if I have anything to say about it :)

Leer gains Thrill Seeker from the Rewards, and Blueborn gets Reflexive Shooter again. It'll be kinda nice for the Hyperelastic bow, at least...

2 more Red Thread is added to our storage for a grand total of SEVEN in our posession. Plenty for the remainder of the campaign, I expect. 

Additionally, we have Bloodletting. Everyone who endeavors there will get 1 Permanent Evasion this year. Shame we'll be down 2 endeavors from that Ergophobia Flit was afflicted with. :/ Oh well, can't complain too much! This showdown went excellently otherwise.

Homeward bound once again! Rough Settlement phase ahead.
