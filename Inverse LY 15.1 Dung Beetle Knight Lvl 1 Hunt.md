||LY 15 Dung Beetle Knight Lvl 1 Hunt||

Very Knight-centric campaign thus far. We lack DBK specific tools (stuff to crack shells super consistently) but we'll be fine. This should be somewhat straightforward regardless.

Special HE - Noodling of Death: 9. Down to the Clear Waters.

Clear Waters: 8. We take the Burnished Encephalomatter and get out in a heartbeat.


Special HE - Mineral Gathering. 3 survivors have picks:

Rose: 5. Broken Lantern and 2 random damage [Arms]

Leer: 7. Iron. We roll 8 on the follow-up and snap the pickaxe.

Blueborn: 2. Hemophobia and 1 Insanity.


Special HE - Herb Gathering:

Rose: 1, 8, 4 (13)

Leer: 10, 5, 8 (23)

Blueborn: 7, 3 (10)

beegoo: (no dice rolled)

Total: 46! 4 survival to everyone, 2 fresh acanthus, 1 Vermin [Nightmare Tick]


Rose Random HE: 19 or 20. I'll pick 20 with Otherworldly Luck. Dry Lands. Everyone loses 1 survival and we gain 1 Iron.


Blueborn DBK HE - Brown Ground. Our party is far too insane to safely Brave the Muck. We'll roll 3 random hunt events.


Blueborn Bonus Random HE: 10! Everyone's favorite, Harvester. No noisy gear, everyone gains a disorder.

Indecision, Seizures, Fear of the Dark, and Indecision. Annoying stuff, but nothing that instantly kills anyone this second. Everyone spends a survival to live and we move on.


Blueborn Bonus Random HE: 02. Corpse. Everyone loses 1 survival and we gain a Basic Resource [Perfect Hide] Nice!


Blueborn Bonus Random HE: 01. Funky chain of rolls. Broken Lanterns. Blueborn will Investigate.

Roll result: 2. 1 Legs damage and +1 courage.


DBK HE - Rolling Fertilizer. We've already done Herb Gathering so the monster simply gains +1 damage token. Great! As usual, glad I lowballed the monster level.

beegoo Bonus Random HE: 53. Mask Salesman. Interesting. Holy shit the random mask we drew is a Death Mask. 

Roll result: 10! beegoo loses their name (and Lucky Charm, for grid space reasons) for the mask.

Their new name will be Stew. Unfortunately, we have affinities completed still, so they will not benefit from the mask. Fortunately, they won't suffer -4 to severe injuries yet either. This has lost us 1 Luck overall which sucks, for the moment.


Special HE - Red Incursion: 5+3+1 (9)

Down to the Elastomer Mines!

Corpse Pit: 6. We'll take the red thread and dive straight to the Grimy Refinery.

Grimy Refinery: 9. 2 Black Resin and we'll dive straight into the Heartwyrm Tunnels!!

Heartwyrm Tunnels: 9!! We add 6 Black Resin and 2 Iron directly to our Settlement Storage. Awesome. We gain 6 insanity and 2 Bleed as well.


Leer Random HE: 20 or 21. I'm a little torn. Free Iron, or a chance to get a ton of Fighting Arts and maybe find stuff like Crazed and Berserker? Realistically 3 people will actually try. I think I'll go for it. I want those BK claws.

21. Drawings. We have Pictographs, everyone may try and get an extra +4 on the roll.


Rose: 4+4 (8). We get 2 survival and Escape Artist.

Leer: 5+4 (9). 2 survival and Timeless Eye

Blueborn: 1+4 (5). 1 insanity.

Showdown time! DBK 1.
