||LY 12 Flower Knight Lvl 2 Hunt||


Blueborn basic: 42, Surgeon. Nobody can really meaningfully make use of it, so we'll skip on ahead.

Weed basic: Wailing Smoke, Straggler time.

4, 1, 2, 3

Weed is the straggler: 1. They gain Photophilia


Forgot to set down my special hunt events earlier, Noodling of Death time!

7, Blueborn gets 2 bleed and a Burnished Encephalomatter. Great, honestly!

Misfortune basic: 2, Corpse. Everyone loses 2 survival and we get a Perfect Hide from our random basic draw.

Root basic: 93, Lost Survivor. We just got pictographs, so we can read the book! However, I will not. It doesn't really serve to improve my situation.

The Forest Wants What it Wants: 2, gross. 4 - str tokens to bring it up to 6 and 2 bleeding tokens ( to weed and root, respectively) to bring us to 8. Then everyone gets another bleed for our trouble. We've got some bandaid work to do.

Blueborn BK FK event: Pool of Secrets. We could use some insanity, so I'll have Misfortune roll on the event since they're carrying dried acanthus: 8! Everyone gains 2 insanity.

Alright, the scary part. Red Incursion: 9. Straight to the elastomer mines! Thank goodness. Misfortune has 1 bleed and has Unconscious Fighter, so she can take 6 without dying. Let's do it.

Corpse Pit: 1, set to 0 insanity, we reach 2 bleed, and reroll.

9, we get 1 Understanding, 1 Red Thread, and can dive straight into the Grimy Refinery. I want to greed here and high-roll.

Grimy Refinery: 2. I'm going to use Weed's reroll here, I want ANY black resin this trip and I don't want my trip cut off so soon. (I know this is certainly stretching the 'survivors who are present' rule but don't worry. Fate will inevitably punish me for my hubris.)

4, Collapsed Lung (cancelled by Dried Acanthus) and 1 Black Resin. We roll again. Man.. It'd be grand hubris to use my entire settlement's final reroll on this just because I'm annoyed that the event is being mean to me, but fuck it. Surely I won't need it in the coming settlement phase :). 

7! 2 black resin and we reach 3 bleed. We roll again.

7 again! 2 more. 1 physical resin card remains. 4 Bleed. We roll again.

2. Deprivation Skinsuit. We'll absolutely take it at this point. 5 resin is a great start, even if we're a little late and spent a lot to get it.

2 pieces of Cursed gear on Misfortune now, and the Monster Grease is made irrelevant by the skinsuit's -10 evasion that I forgot lol.

Mineral Gathering, Weed rolls: 10! Straight into the Worm Tunnels for everyone who can manage, plus we pull a Broken Lantern from the deck.

Weed First because they have a Sickle: 11. 1 Iron or dipping into the Crystal Lake for 2 survival. Why not: 1! 2 armor everywhere and Crystal Skin next LY. Neat, novel. We can work with that. 

Misfortune Worm Tunnels: 6, -2 survival +2 insanity.

Root Worm Tunnels: 7, same as above.

Blueborn Worm Tunnels: 5, same as above.

No Iron! But that's okay, we got Crystal Skin which will be neat to have in the future.

Herb Gathering: All survivors gain 1 survival immediately.

10, 5, 1 - 16

6, 2, 1 - 9

8, 2, 8 - 0

8, 2, 8 - 0 (crazy duplicate roll)

Total (+10 from being beyond OD): 35, Fresh Acanthus +1 survival for all. Another year, another missed Cooking payoff when I could really use it.

Weed FK Hunt event: Whispering Leaves. Jesus, this event does bleed. Luckily nobody will die from it, but good to know it exists. I need to get out of this FK vortex, man.

3, 1, 6, 5

Blueborn and Weed set insanity to 0, Misfortune and Root gain 1 Bleed and 1 or 5 insanity, respectively.

We arrive and the showdown begins!
