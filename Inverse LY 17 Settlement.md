||LY 17 Settlement - Secret Meeting||


7 endeavors after pariah stole one on its way out.

Even more rude, our parallel play special rules for the year have forced us to resolve a Sulking punishment even though we won. We'll take the Heartsick Breath Stench and spend another of our endeavors to cure it, probably. Later, though. First:


Random SE: Acid Storm AGAIN. I promise I shuffle this deck lmao. Well, not need to use that endeavor I was thinking of using I guess.

Roll result: 2. Leer is forced to Skip Next Hunt again. 


Next up, The Bell Rings again! That's right, back-to-back nemesis action!

Second Ring. I nominate Stew and Rose.

Rose: Departing survivors suffer -2 survival and +2 insanity. Not too bad, all things considered.

Stew: 8. Stew refuses to depart this year, alongside Leer. Fair enough. I think we ought to be able to manage this regardless. Hopefully.


Secret Meeting: I nominate 2 to gain +1 understanding (triggering Insight). They gain Secretive and we add Secret Meeting Pt 2 to LY 20.

Insight: 8. +1 acc. Nice! I need to remember to get them to 3+ Hunt XP before LY 20. We also draw Jarngreipr from the Seed Pattern Deck. Funny that we actually have Acid Rain this year, but no Thunder Maul. Not sure I'd craft it anyway even though I have all the resources lol. I probably would.

We get to Develop, which triggers Morgue. We draw a Love Juice- Helpful, sorta.

Let's get to innovating: Bloodletting, Memento Mori, Saga, and Scrap Smelting.

Easy Saga! Now our newborns are at pretty much peak performance, and we have no reason to hold back on intimacy when we have spare endeavors and love juice.


We've got a severe lack of synchro strikes for our departing survivors as a consequence of some of our main strikers skipping this next hunt, functionally, and 2 consecutive years of having no Music endeavors so we can't learn Synchro. I don't love that going into BK who has a lot of mean reactions, but having Iron Will on our Vespertine Bow Death Mask user should to an incredible, absurd amount of work in the fight. I think they'll be able to broadly carry solo, and we can use B&R to continue evasion tanking as we did in this last fight.

Looks like the rest of these endeavors go toward appeasing the pariah and then using face painting to then convert into some intimacy now that we've got the whole saga + clan of death shebang.

2 endeavors toward appeasing pariah and then guaranteed face painting hit thanks to acid rain this year

Love juice, Leer and Blueborn for double Otherworldly luck intimacy safety guarantee.

7, they cap survival and we get a kid.

Our Saga newborn triggers Age 1: 13. A random fighting art. Escape artist. I'd like to see berserker so that I can make the BK token stripping katar.

A little bit of augury: 7. Nothing, really.

8 > Intimacy!

Intimacy: 6, kid no fanfare. For Age 1 they get Inversion.

Augury, 8

Another loop: 4, kid no ribbons.

Age 1: 8. Strategist. It'll be good if I ever go for dbk3.

Augury: 11

Intimacy 7

Age 1: 7, Soft landing. Berserker continues evading me.

3 badges out this year, should be interesting to see what tactics show up for us.

Off to Black Knight 2.
