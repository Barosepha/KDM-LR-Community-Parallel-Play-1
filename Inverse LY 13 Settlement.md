||LY 13 Settlement Phase - The Bell Tolls||


Our special parallel play rules this year: A devastating disease descends upon our humble abode that kills 2 survivors! Unless we spend 2 endeavors, which we do, obviously lol. We are also afforded the opportunity to add Plague to the timeline next year to remove it  from our deck permanently. Honestly? Fuck it, why not. We do so.

On to a lot of events!

Random Settlement Event: Triathalon of Death! I'm not going to think about this that hard, we'll throw in our returning survivors minus Misfortune plus Leer.

Race: Everyone has 5 Movement in this settlement so it's down to the die rolls

1st: A Tie! Blueborn and Root both gain +1 once per lifetime Movement.

2nd: Weed

3rd: Leer

4th: Nobody!

Debate: It doesn't look good for Weed and Root.

1st: 7+9, 16 for Blueborn!

2nd: 3+8, 11 for Leer.

3rd: A Tie! 3+1, 4 for both Root and Weed.

4th Nobody! Lucky break-ish. They both need to Skip Next Hunt. We will have a very small hunting party this year.

Fight: Nobody really stands out (except Leer)

1st: 2+5, 7 for Leer! Wasted unfortunately, as they already have mastery. Oopsies, whatever!

2nd: 4+1, 5 for Blueborn, more stats for whoever inherits the Guest when they Die I suppose.

3rd: 2+2, 4 for Root, Extra Sense sounds nice to have!

4th: 1+1, 2 for poor old Weed. Their arm is dismembered. Nbd.


Not bad, but not great. This has made our coming encounter with the black knight potentially extremely awkward because of Flower Addiction and Skip Next Hunts. We'll figure it out.


Waiting Bell: The Bell Rings is added to our Timeline 


Bone Witch: Root is forced to Endeavor here.

They roll 3! Brutal, (6 on the secondary roll) -3 permanent accuracy, +3 permament strength. That will make them a little more  difficult to make use of, honestly.


A Warm Virus:

I was going to choose Root as the Host, but honestly after the -3 acc Bone Witch thing I'm much less excited to do so. I'll choose Weed and lose Crystal Skin. It's not an ability I adore using anyway, and they're currently in a state where they'd struggle to be sent out on a departure anyway. We roll a 10, departing survivors will get 1 Courage and Str token this year. Helpful!

beegoo overwrites Weed, triggering Insight and Bold. Contentious Choice, but I'll also include the SFA's beegoo has in the transference as well. Just feels good.

Insight: 8, +1 acc

Bold: 5, +1 endeavor

Frustratingly, as much as I'd like to take them to the Black Knight, I can't find any mechanical justification for removing Skip Next Hunt as a consequence of this event.


The Bell Rings!: We gain the Bell of Challenge and Misfortune steps up to the calling. Unfortunately not enough courage on her to get the count treukh pattern if we roll that result.

10! They gain Piercer, to be re-replaced with Synchronized strike lol.

Also Sense Memory is happening I guess.


And we're done with events for the moment!

We're staring down the Black Knight and we have 5 total survivors in our settlement. 2 must Skip Next Hunt and 1 has Flower Addiction. Difficult position! Let's see what we can do with it.

First, 1 endeavor and a variety of flower resources makes for an innovation:

Shrine, Bloodletting, Sculpture, and Memento Mori. 3 innovations we want *eventually* but there is a 'best choice', I think. As much as I'd like to take Bloodletting in preparation for our scheduled Plague next year, I will take Sculpture. Once we gain Otherworldly Luck from somewhere or, worst case, get Pottery and tutor it out via Sense Memory, we'll have to much juice for our special hunt events.

Still. Not. Face Painting. I'm running out of time to stall, here...

As you should be well aware by now, our population woes dictate that our two Warbling Blooms are immediately made into 2 more Flower Faced population. Rose and Thorn, simple enough.

Next! We may endeavor once at the Waiting Bell for free. We'll give Leer Honorable to overwrite their Flower Addiction, so they can Depart this year. We're up to 3 valid survivors now. Do we risk Intimacy for a 4th? I'll consider it.

Oh hey, Blueborn is Retired. Yeesh. Back down to 2... I am truly uncomfortable with the idea of walking into Black Knight with so few bodies. The judgement call here is essentially: What do we need our 4 endeavors for? We can use them to Trepan and try to get rid of Flower Addiction on our new Warbling survivors first, if we really need to. Then, failing that, we can try to use them for intimacy. I'd like synchro on my two main fighting survivors for this showdown, so I'm looking at 2 endeavors remaining. Lots of things that might be good to do with those, but I think this is the line.


Trepanning Rose: 4. Flower Addiction Removed.

Trepanning Thorn: 9. Functionally nothing happens. I want a fourth survivor here. 3 is nearly 'good enough' for me but I think I have to aim for the fourth. The risk/reward isn't obscene here.

Love Juice, Rose and Thorn participate in Intimacy: 4, 7. We're forced to take 4 and gain 1 population. That's 4 departing survivors, nice. We'll name him Heart.

Only two of our prospective departers have 3+ understanding, so we'll lack some bonus to our roll after the BK fight, but let's reach that point before we think too hard about it. 

Our last 2 endeavors go to Synchro Strike on Leer and Misfortune.

Now we've just got to figure out what to do with our spare grid space since we don't need to take so much of our hunt phase utility gear.

Just re-checked my math and I have 1 more endeavor than I was accounting for! I'll go ahead and Leather-ify the hide I have on hand right now including the lantern blooms. +6 leather, nice. I think I'll go ahead and make an almanac for once.

Okie dokie, here we go...
