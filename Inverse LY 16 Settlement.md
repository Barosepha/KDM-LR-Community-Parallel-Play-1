||LY 16 Settlement - Pariah's Second Challenge||


Pariah Level 2 awaits us after this settlement phase, and then next year we have Black Knight 2. We'll need to be ever so slightly sparing with resources to make sure we have enough resources to continue innovating and stuff.

We have 9 endeavors.

Our Special Parallel Play rules allow us to remove Hooded Knight from the timeline altogether! We'll take the opportunity. It's pretty late for a Twilight Sword at this point, so the knight is really just going to be a nuisance. Bye bye Hooded Knight!


Random Settlement Event - Acid Storm: 5. Leer is the most insane survivor, so they must Skip Next Hunt. No problem. We're also prevented from using Music endeavors, so no dropping synchro on people this year, as much as I'd like to.

And that's all! Now we're onto the Develop step. We get a ??? from Morgue.


Innovation with basic resources: Bloodletting, Petal Spiral, Character, and Scrap Smelting. Character for sure! We should get Scrap Smelting from the Weapon Crafter soon so we can stop drawing it like this.

I'd like to complete Blueborn's weapon mastery and also clear their Fear of the Dark. I think I'll give them Honorable with the Bell rather than trying to go through Trepanning. (Oh hey, leer was honorable and shouldn't have been able to attack DBK while it was knocked down last showdown! Oh well.)

Blueborn Nightmare Training (With Otherworldly Luck!): 7>4> (Lonely ant back up to 6 survival) > 4 > 3 > 5 > 4 > 7

1 survival remaining, but we got there! Shield Mastery!! Lovely stuff.

6 Endeavors remaining.

My shortage of organs is causing me duress. To make the wet resin crafter, I need organs. To innovate, I need organs. To facilitate a higher level Black Harvest and Bury gear I need Preserved Caustic Dung, which are Organs i could otherwise be using for other stuff. DBK Errant badge requires an organ (along with lots of the dbk gear, including specific dbk resources.) Whatever, I'm just going to do stuff. ???'s will be organs, shortages are what they're for.


2 bones, 2 ???, and an endeavor makes a Wet Resin Crafter.

We make a Century Shoulder Pads trivially. This is the only thing we can make right now that we can calcify, and I don't think I'll go too hard on trying to make extras atm. Maybe one more in the future as just generic 'good' gear to calcify with the greaves and stuff, but no rush right now.


Black Harvest time! Burying our Shoulder Pad here means we're basically locked into DBK2 LY 18 and maybe 20 to make sure we can lock in all of the harvests we need, but that's okay! This is also an opportunity to potentially kill some survivors for Cannibalize draws in the pursuit of gaining Organs. I think I'll put 3 survivors in and see what happens.

Root, Brush, and Value.

Roll result: 13. They live! Bit of a shame, but it won't hurt to have spare bodies going into Red Cannon. Black Harvest is added to LY 20.

We'll have New bury the shoulder pads: 8. They succeed and gain 1 Understanding. Now we wait.

1 endeavor and a caustic dung to level up Black Harvest to 2.

I think I want a hyperelastic shield. Super cheap, triggers our global shield spec for extra armor, powerful 1/showdown basically AI card cancel. I'll make one.

As usual, I am interested in the durability afforded by a DBK badge. I will make one despite my shortage of organs. Blueborn will be entering this showdown with a Death Mask and 7 armor at every hit location. Comfy cozy.

I think I'm going to take a couple cracks at storytelling with Rose:

1: +1 Understanding

9: White Speaker is Dead. Oops. We'll put Root into the Story of the Bleeding Heart

Roll result: 10 on the die makes 12. Not enough white speakers to get Boost Heart, but they do gain +1 permanent accuracy. Scraping them back from unusability at -3 lol.


Thus, we depart for the Pariah. We're geared to the teeth. Hopefully nobody gets too debilitated.
