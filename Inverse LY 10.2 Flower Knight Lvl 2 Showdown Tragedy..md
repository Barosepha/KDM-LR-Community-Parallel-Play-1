||LY 10 Flower Knight Lvl 2 Showdown||

Everyone wipes their -str tokens with SotB and Vine gains 3 Insanity from the Screaming Leg Warmers. Our random terrain is an Obsidian Pillar, which is nice. That's pretty likely to be some extra Iron for our trouble.

Pillar: [7-8,3-4]

Flower Patches: [11,2] and [12,2]

Drifter: [9,4]

Vine: [12,3]

Sprout: [14,4]


Turn 1 is immensely dangerous here. We have a ton of heavy injuries in random spots already and very well might get Bloom and Doomed into the pit with the knight which could be horrific. Nonetheless, we have no choice.


Round 1 [Drifter MC]:

AI Draw: Noxious, draw another card.

AI Draw: Disarm

Bloom [Sprout]

Sprout is placed at [13,4], doomed, and gains +1 luck token.

FK targets Sprout

FK Moves to [11-12,4-5]

Attack: 7, 7, 5 (3 hits, Body x2 and Head)

2 Body severe injuries: 9 (Collapse Lung) and 1 (Instant Death)

Awesome. Cannibalize gets us a Monster Bone. Now we have absolutely no deck scouting. Sweating.

Survivors' Turn:

Vine acts

Surge to activate Flower Patch. Guaranteed flower resource [Osseous Bloom] and +1 luck token. 

Movement to [11,3]

Activate Flower Patch. Flower Resource [Osseous Bloom] and +1 luck token

Act ends

Drifter acts

Activate Obsidian Tower: 7, Broken Lantern

Dash x2 (Just to progress Chain Dash) to [11,6]

Drifter is knocked down by noxious


Round 2 [Dead MC]:

Draw AI: Glissade [Drifter]

Drifter takes 1 brain damage

Attack: 5, 2, 2 (0 hits)

Survivors' Turn:

Vine acts

Beast Knuckle (Synchro active)

Attack rolls: 6, 10 (2 hits, 1 perfect, Glowing Eyes and Fey Hilt)

Drifter will spend 1 Survival to turn Fey Hilt into a Failure reaction

Glowing Eyes: 11 (Wound)

Drifter suffers 2 brain damage

Fey Hilt: 8 (Wound)

Movement to [12,3]

Act ends

Drifter acts

Dash to [12,6]

Rank up Chain Dash to Chain Dash II

Long Club (Synchro active)

Attack: 4, 6, 8 (3 hits, Delicate Knee Joint, Writhing Flora, Fey Sabatons)

Inconsequential reactions, so rapid fire wound attempts: Natural 1, Impervious non-crit, 13 (1 wound)

Drifter is knocked back 5

Dash back into prior position

Vine Surges to activate Beast Knuckle

Attack: 10, 5 (2 hits, 1 perfect)

Trap! (Card 6/18)

Drifter is already in the circle, so they won't bother spending survival to avoid to pull.

Basic [Vine]

Attack: 3, 6, 8 (3 hits, Legs x2 and Arms)

3 severe injuries: Legs 9 (Bloody Thighs) Legs 1 (Blood Geyser. Dead)

That's good, they were the one with all the Luck as well. We must pray 5 evasion drifter can solo this, I guess. My hopes are not extremely high. Cannibalize adds a Love Juice to the Settlement Storage. That's Scav Kit offline for this fight too, lowering our odds to get warbling blooms a little bit. Oh well.

Noxious knocks down the Drifter


Round 3 [Dead MC]:

AI Draw: Nature Reflection (Legendary card, love that.) Not going to specify target now because there is only one possible. Drifter has 1 melee weapon in their gear grid, the Long Club, so this attack will be doing 5 damage.

Attack: 2, 6, 3 (0 hits)

Not looking forward to seeing that again.

Survivor's Turn:

Drifter acts

Dash to the Blind Spot

Long Club attack: 1, 8, 10 (2 hits, 1 perfect. Fey Helm Wings, Hypnotic Deflection)

1 wound, failed the parry. Drifter gains prio target token and 2 insanity. I think I need to run out of the ring to trigger Bloom and get a little extra Luck. Not like I can dodge anyway. My main concern is Bleed and the +2 bleed sting card, but I really can't be playing around that stuff right now.

Movement to [12,15]

Drifter gains 1 Bleed.

Act ends


Round 4 [Dead MC]:

AI Draw: Appel

Bloom

Drifter is placed at [12,13], is doomed, and gains +1 luck token.

Drifter is targeted

FK Movement to [11-12,11-12]

Attack: 5, 5 (0 hits)

Survivor's Turn:

Dash to Blind Spot

Long Club attack: 3, 8, 3 (3 hits, Fey Hilt, Glowing Eyes, Retreating Feint)

Glowing Eyes: 3 on the die, 7 total. (Failure)

Fey Hilt: Lantern 10 (Wound, no crit effect)

FK Moves to the center of the board, causing Collision and ending the attack.

Act ends


Round 5 [Drifter MC]:

AI Draw: Stinging Breeze [No Target]

Germinate: Drifter loses a +1 Luck token. Ugh.

Survivor's Turn:

Dash to the blind spot

Long Club attack (This is genuinely all I can do): 5, 9, 8 (3 hits, Fey Breeches, Hypnotic Deflection, Furious Riposte)

Fey Breeches: 8 on the die (Would have crit if we didn't just lose that luck token! Instead we Wound)

Drifter gains 1 Courage and spends a survival to avoid getting knocked down. For reaching 3 Courage, he gains 2 strength. That brings us to wounding on 2 instead of 4, nice.

Hypnotic Deflection (Parry): 2 (Failure)

+2 insanity

Furious Ripose (Parry I'm afraid of): 8 on the die. Genuinely fuck me, man. Of all cards why'd it have to be the one that fails to target and give monster controller insanity AND Germinate to remove the luck token that wound have allowed us to crit two additional times now. Now I may die to this Basic.

Basic [Drifter]

Attack: 5, 1, 7 (1 hit, Body)

Dash to [12,2]

Drifter gains 1 bleed. Up to 3 now.

Act ends


Round 6 [Dead MC]:

AI Draw: Vail Flourish

Bloom twice (Drifter can't be bloomed twice because they'll only be outside of the fairy ring for the first)

Drifter is placed at [12,4], is doomed, and gains +1 Luck token.

FK Movement to [11-12,5-6]

Attack: 10, 1 (1 hit. This is incredibly bad.)

2 damage to the body, Bleed 1. Drifter is at 4 Bleed, and has a Body light injury.

Survivor's Turn:

Drifter Acts

Dash to the Blind Spot

Long Club attack: 9, 5, 3 (3 hits, Delicate Shoulder Joint, Armored Back, Retreating Feint)

Delicate Shoulder Joint: 13 (Wound. 1 off a crit again.)

Armored Back: 13: (Wound)

Retreating Feint (Parry): Natural 6 (Failure). Flower Knight returns to the center of the board, causing Collision in the meanwhile.

Act ends


Round 7 [Dead MC]:

AI Draw: Appel [Drifter]

If this hits at all, we take knockback 7 out of the fairy ring and bleed to death.

Attack: 1, 9. 1 hit. We have a Lifetime reroll, we will use it on that 9. It becomes a 3. 0 hits.

Drifter stands

Survivor's Turn:

Drifter Acts

I'll burn both of these fresh acanthus to heal the Body and Legs

Dash to the blind spot

Long Club attack: 10, 2, 3 (3 hits, 1 perfect.)

Trap! (Card 13/18) It was inevitable. We just have to keep surviving. 

Attack: 9, 2, 4 (1 hit, Legs)

Wouldn't have been a severe even if I didn't acanthus, but I'm glad I did regardless. The trap also kindly gives us a new Luck token. I really hope Glissade is still in the deck.

Act ends

Noxious knocks down the Drifter


Round 8 [Dead MC]:

AI Draw: Vain Flourish

There are no Threads in the Fairy ring currently. The Flower Knight tries to Bloom twice to no avail and then Germinates, taking away one of our Luck tokens. I'm fine with this card being here.

Drifter stands

Survivor's Turn:

Drifter acts

Dash to blind spot

Long club attack: 5, 1, 10 (2 hits, 1 perfect.)

Trap! (Card 2/18 yaay!)

We get another Luck token

Attack: 1, 9, 5 (1 hit, Body)

That would have been a severe and ended the fight outright if we had not used the acanthus earlier.

Act ends

Noxious knocks down the Drifter


Round 9 [Drifter MC]:

AI Draw: Disarm

Drifter is made to stand

Attack: 2, 6, 9 (1 hit, Head)

Any damage to the Head from this point on is a severe and will usually kill us.

The Drifter is Disarmed and can now only attack with Fist and Tooth.

Survivor's Turn:

Dash to blind spot

Fist and tooth attack: 7, 1, 7 (2 hits, Floewring Bustle and Fey Helm Wings)

Flowering Bustle: Natural 8 (Critical Wound)

Drifter spends 2 survival to gain 1 permanent accuracy.

Fey helm Wings: Lantern 10 (Critical Wound)

The Flower Knight gains -1 accuracy token, and the Drifter gain +1 Luck token and 1 Flower resource [Lantern Bloom]

The Flower knight has kindly reminded me that I'm holding 2 Osseous Blooms. The Drifter will devour one to get rid of all 4 of his bleeding tokens and gain Flower Addiction. This makes our odds of getting the warbling blooms we want so bad now even worse, but we need to see the other side of this fight.

Act ends

Noxious knocks down the Drifter


Round 10 [Dead MC]:

AI Draw: Vain Flourish

Germinate. Drifter loses 1 Luck token.

Drifter stands

Survivor's turn:

Drifter acts

Dash to blind spot

F&T attack: 4, 2, 1 (1 hit)

Hypnotic Deflection (Parry): Natural 1 (Failure)

+2 insanity

Noxious knocks down the Drifter


Round 11 [Dead MC]:

AI Draw: Disarm [Drifter]

The Drifter is made to stand

Attack: 10, 10, 9. Fuck me. (3 hits Head, Body x2)

Body heavy injury knocks us back down, skipping our turn at best. Head severe is a coin flip to kill us.

4. death. However, fuck that. We have exactly 1 lifetime reroll left in our entire settlement, back home tied to beegoo. She will give that up despite her lack of presence because I'm not letting this go out this way.

The result is a 9. Shattered Jaw. We fight on.

Drifter loses their turn, triggering their neurosis and gaining an additional Bleeding token.


Round 12 [Dead MC]:

AI Draw: Disarm

The Drifter is made to stand

Attack: 10, 9, 8. Great examples of the whole range of values that are currently able to hit us. (3 hits, Legs, Arms, Waist)

Survivor's Turn:

Drifter acts

Dash to blind spot

F&T attack: 1, 9, 1. 1 hit, and we're guaranteed not to wound off Disarm. Yikes.

Hypnotic Deflection (Parry): Natural 3 (Failure)

+2 insanity

Act ends

Noxious knocks the Drifter down


Round 13 [Drifter MC]:

AI Draw: Vain Flourish

Germinate: Drifter loses 1 Luck token.

Drifter stands

Survivor's Turn:

Dash to blind spot

F&T attack: 6, 1, 5 (2 hits, Furious Ripost and Fey Sabatons. What a nightmare.)

Fey Sabatons: 7 (Failure)

Furious Riposte (Parry): Natural 3 (Failure)

Basic action targeting Drifter

Attack: 7, 6, 10 (1 hit, Legs)

Legs heavy injury knocks us down

Act ends


Round 14 [Dead MC]:

AI Draw: Vain Flourish

Germinate, we lose 1 Luck token

Drifter Stands

Survivor's Turn:

Drifter acts

Dash to blind spot

F&T attack: 3, 6, 2 (1 hit)

Writhing Flora (Impervious): Lantern 10. We crit, gain a luck token and the priority target token, and apply Bruised Ego to the monster, discarding Noxious. That sucks on so many levels. But, it does allow us to avoid Disarm this turn, at least.

Movement to [13,3]

Act ends


Round 15: I will now stop noting monster controllers other than the Drifter for the remainder of this showdown.

AI Draw: Disarm 

Drifter Dashes to [17,3] and gains 1 Bleed token

FK moves to [14-15,3-4]

Survivor's Turn:

Drifter acts

Movement + Dash into blind spot outside of the Fairy Ring

F&T attack: 2, 8, 7 (2 hits, Fey Hilt and Furious Riposte)

Fey Hilt: 5 (Failure. 2 on the die.) Fuck.

Furious Riposte: Natural 2. (Failure)

Basic targeting Drifter

Attack: 8, 9, 8. 3 hits, right within our 5 evasion strike zone. For those keeping track, in the space of its last 4 attacks it's hit 10/12 attack rolls with 30% odds to hit. I'll let you compare that to all of my other rolls this fight, including the set of 2 consecutive 2's that have once again fucked us.

Head, Waist, Arms. A Head severe injury again. 5 on the die, 1 systemic pressure. 4 total. Death. Intracranial hemorrhage would have done us in in the long term nonetheless. Fate did not see it in the cards to have us see this through. Devastating, and potentially a death knell for this settlement. We lose everything we gathered on the hunt, and the Flower Knight has the discourtesy of preventing us from gaining a cannibalize resource from the Drifter. I'd un-do the skull and love juice it gave us earlier for the Defeat effect, but that's not how any of this works.
