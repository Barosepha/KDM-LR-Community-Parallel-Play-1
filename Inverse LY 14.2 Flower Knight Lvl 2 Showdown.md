||LY 14 Flower Knight Lvl 2||

Our 6th, and hopefully final for a long time, Flower Knight showdown.

Arrival, red fist, screaming leg warmers, you know the drill.

Our random terrain is Tall Grass.


Round 1 [Thorn MC]:

AI Draw: Cocoon.

Underwhelming start. People might say 'Man this showdown will be so easy! You should have taken a level 3.' but frankly I've been overwhelmingly fortunate thus far. I wouldn't count on this luck unless I needed to, and I could have just as easily wiped this year and ended my campaign if things went the other way (like they did a few years ago lol.)

Survivors' Turn:

Rose acts

Headband: Glissade x2. Lmao.

Movement

Act ends

TLDR for the remainder of this round, everyone steps into the tall grass, I remove some bleed from Misfortune, and we pass.


Round 2 [beegoo MC]:

AI Draw: Glissade [Misfortune]

1 brain damage

FK moves to the edge of the fairy ring

Attack rolls: 8, 10, 10. Thank goodness I'm not facing level 3.

B&R Cuirass cancels a hit with the -acc token it gave Misfortune. 1 Leg and Waist damage, and the monster runs back to the center of the board.

Survivors' Turn:

beegoo harvests the second Flower Patch (we have a lantern bud and lantern bloom now) and then we pass.


Round 3 [Rose MC]:

AI draw: Glissade [Misfortune]

Deja vu, same stuff happens.

Attack rolls: 7, 7, 8. :/ 2 hits after the cuirass again.

Waist and Body. I was hoping it would get 1 less hit so we could dodge and get it stuck outside of the fairy ring, but no such luck. Again, glad I'm facing level 2.

Survivors' Turn:

Rose acts

Headband: Salute, Pommel Punch. Salute on top.

Grappleclaw attack: 1, 3, 10 (2 hits. Fey Breeches, Retreating Feint)

Fey Breeches: 12 (Wound)

Pay 1 survival to stay standing and gain 1 courage.

Retreating Feint (Parry ignored): Natural 1. I'm losing my mind lmao. (Failure)

To be clear, beegoo ONLY fails on a 1. I reiterate, thank goodness I'm fighting level 2.

FK steps 3 spaces toward the center of the board.

Math looks like we'll need to get that Fated Blow devastating wound in and not miss any to get this done without the trap, although the trap wouldn't be *too* bad.

Rose acts

Headband: Glissade x2.

Act ends

Round 6 [beegoo MC]:

AI Draw: Glissade [Misfortune]

1 brain damage

Movement

Attack rolls: 7, 10, 6. 1 hit, cancelled by B&R Cuirass.

Survivors' Turn: 

Misfortune acts

F&T attack: 10, 3>6 unfortunately, the reroll on misses is NOT elective. (2 hits. Fey Helm Wings, Hypnotic Deflection)

Fey Helm Wings (Fated Blow!): 21 (Devastating Wound)

Misfortune gains prio target token.

Hypnotic Deflection: Natural 10! Neat. (Critical Wound)

Breakthrough!: Natural 10 again! Everyon gains 1 survival and 2 insanity, and Misfortune gains Fencing.

I suppose the nat 1 luck has evened out. I do wish it was slightly less extreme so we weren't in this particular position, though. 3 Hit locations in the deck, 1 AI card in the deck. We have 2 non trap hit locations that we know are on top of the trap, and 2 wounds left to inflict. beegoo is extremely accurate and has 3 speed, so they're sort of out until we decide we can only do it with the Trap. Thorn time!

Act ends

Thorn acts

Movement up to FK

Beast Knuckle attack: 7, 6. Lucky! (2 hits. Armored Back, Writhing Flora)

Ah, right. There's an impervious hit location.

Armored Back: 8 (Wound)

Writhing Flora (Impervious): Natural 2 (Failure)

Only the Trap left now. It's fine.

Act ends

beegoo acts

Grappleclaw attack: 8, 3, 1>3 (3 hits.)

Trap! Everyone but beegoo spends 1 survival and FK takes beegoo on a journey into the Fairy Ring.

Beegoo Surges

Grappleclaw attack: 10, 7, 4 (3 hits.)

Flower Knight dies. 

2 Hunt XP, 1 Weapon Prof for those applicable.

Rose Age 1: 6, +1 str

Misfortune Age 4, retirement, F&T mastery: +1 luck, 2 str, 2 acc. Lots of juicy stats. Wish I had another Flower,  but it's okay. Maybe if we topple the bell we'll take her out again!
