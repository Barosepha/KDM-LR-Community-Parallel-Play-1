||LY 19 Settlement Phase - Two Visits from Nico||

We come home with 9 whole endeavors. Those will be nice.


Random SE - Triathalon of Death.

For simplicity I think I'll throw in our 4 recent Character'd up newborns, just so we don't have to deal with anything truly troublesome happening to people that matter. For the purposes of these tests, they're currently all identical, so I can just go by d10's. I won't go into the full results since it's inconsequential and a lot to type, but I'll let you know if anything neat happens.

Our Adventurer hit Bold and has an Endeavor reroll, but got otherwise fucked up by gaining apathetic and a Dismembered Arm

Gatherer hit Tinker and got us a 10th endeavor

The Parent hit Ethereal Pact, which is fun.


Next, time for A Visit From Nico:

Stew is our Highest Courage survivor and it's not close. Thankfully, we've rid ourselves of the Sword of Silence in time to avoid this event being extremely deadly.

Result: 5. Stew gains Post Traumatic Stress and suffers a Gaping Chest Wound, losing 1 permanent strength


We have also gifted ourselves Necrotoxic Mistletoe this year:

Our returning survivors cap survival, which may be nice for some Nightmare Training or something.

I'll be optimistically selecting Burrow, the Parent as our Health-Conscious individual, in no small part because it triggers Bold and Insight on them simultaneously and empties our Seed Pattern deck for the campaign. They gain 1 permanent strength and net us an 11th endeavor for this settlement phase.

Check Up: 2 (reroll) > 6. Unfortunately this is the worst result, just one off of getting us an Acanthus Doctor as well. Burrow leaves with 3 other doomed survivors, preventing us from even gaining Cannibalize benefits from their deaths. Shame. But not too bad! Thankfully our survivor count can eat this hit without too much trouble.

Morgue officially gives us 2 resources this year: Love Juice, Monster Bone.


Carrying on, let's innovate: Shrine, Bloodletting, Hovel, and Scrap Smelting.

Shrine is tempting because it leads into Sacrifice, which I need in order to complete the strain I haven't done yet, which would be nice. That being said, Hovel would be nice for the extra survival limit and departing survival, bringing us just back into double digits. Third consideration is Bloodletting, because we could endeavor up a lot of extra Evasion at it next year, which is tempting... I like getting Bloodletting just in time for the special outcome, sure, why not.


I'll happily spend 1 endeavor and preserved Caustic dung to bring our Black Harvest up to rank 3.


Okay, not a testament to my grand hubris. We're Heart Fluting up the next red witches fight to double dip on Braal & Nico to fill our red thread needs for the forseeable future completely.

Of course, inconsequential survivors will be used as fodder for it.

Strike Heart Flute: 2 (reroll) > 5 Dead.

We add a Perfect Bone to settlement storage thanks to Cannibalize.

Value Heart Flute: 2 (Reroll) > 10. We add Red Witches Level 2 as a Special Showdown to this year!

I'm just crafting up some bandages to replace those I lost and running this right now before we spend any more endeavors, just so we know our situation going into the 'real' showdown and forseeable future. Fuck it we ball. Same departing survivors as before, let's run it!


----- Red Witches Lvl 2. Interlude ---


It went very well! Looking forward to the refight shortly as well. Main difference is we will be leaving Stew at home in order to allow them to recover from their Post Traumatic Stress, so we'll need to prepare another survivor to fill the slot, including a more competent weapon than the grappleclaw. Stew has been carrying the weapon as opposed to the weapon carrying the survivor for a while now, but I think there may be options we can consider available to us right now. 

In pursuit of this goal, we'll be moving the Worn Brawling Bow over to the Count set in order to take advantage of its triple red affinity ability, and then we'll use the spare Century Fingernails we got (we only need one for the harness eventually!) to craft up a beautiful digging claw. Hyper accurate weapon with just enough strength to get by in this upcoming fight, and then we can calcify it next year to give it Sharp for endgame use. It won't be scratching DBK but it'll be adequately in the weight class of level 3 monsters.

It's worth considering leaving Blueborn at home as well because they're getting dangerously near to Dark Secret, which would be quite bad, but I think it's worth using their 1 remaining 'free' understanding for this nemesis encounter to insure that we do well against the Parry monster that is Nico, and then we can wait until after Inverted Pariah kindly removes Implanted Memories from our innovation list to continue using them.

Speaking of keeping people we care about alive, in service of that goal I think I need to pad out my population with some intimacy this year in preparation for the upcoming Red Witch Trials. There's all manner of possibility that they select someone with irreplaceable gear that I don't want to lose, so I'd like to minimize those odds how I can.

Blueborn Face Painting (OL): 5. We get out +1 bonus to intimacy, netting us guaranteed safe intimacy this year between two Otherworldly Luck survivors.

Love Juice Intimacy (Leer + Blueborn): 9, 7 (+3) 10! Twins! we do not have Hovel so no savior but I don't mind.

The first Character card is The Queen and they get Crazed from Age, which is great. If we get Sacrifice we might be able to do the Carnage Worms strain!

Next gains The Sword and Freeclimber

Love Juice 2: 7, 1. We'll spend a nobody's reroll just in case we can get twins again.

1>10 Nice! That's another 10 after modifiers for a second set of twins.

First gains The Tough and +1 Luck from Age. Neat! I'll keep an eye on them as a potential Blueborn replacement.

Second gains The Adventurer and Inversion. One day we'll get Berserker, I swear...

We'll spend an Organ and an endeavor to on Pottery to make another Love Juice and use it: 5, 7. 8 after mods.

No twins, but our survivors cap out their Survival at least. This new survivor gains The Clever and 1 Str from Age.

I think It's time I dip into Scarification to get more people to 3 Courage, maybe get some Matchmakers and keep this train going.

Root Scarification: Head, Blind but Dried Acanthus eats it. Bold rolls a 7, we refund the endeavor.

Leer: Blind and and Endeavor result reroll. 

Blueborn is a risk, we could Double blind them and retire them accidentally here. I think I take it and use that reroll we just got if I need to: Arms, +1 permanent luck. Damn that's great on them. +1 Str from Bold as well.

We're down to 3 and have 3 Matchmakers. I'd like to spend a couple of those on getting Trick Transport, but realistically 1 survival limit is no rush and more bodies to minimize important death odds is priority 1 right now, I believe. 

Matchmaker: 6, 6. 9 after mods is more twins!

First gains Magma and Unconscious fighter. Maybe a new B&R armor survivor for after Leer's retirement.

Next gains Unbreakable and The Queen

Matchmaker: 6, 10. 9 is more twins!

First gains +1 acc and The Mighty

Next gains The Berserker (not Berserker unfortunately) and +1 acc

Matchmaker: 1>9, 6. 9 after modifiers. We used another reroll to get another set of twins!

Tumble and Unlucky, Unconscious Fighter and The Sword. No Morgans, no Berserkers, but TONS of bodies for the trials. We've almost doubled our population here, which should help our statistics quite a lot.

We'll craft up 2 more Dried Acanthus for good measure.

It has occurred to my that my current Count grid could technically support Weaponsmith's hammer to make the Worn Brawling Bow impeccable. That's cute, so I'm going to craft it and do it, even though it means I won't be taking Acanthus on them and putting them in somewhat more danger than I'd like. I'm also passing the spiked buckler over to that grid to trigger Shield spec and get a couple extra armor points for good measure.

No synchro pairs, limited honorable. We're still well geared for this though, I trust that we'll be able to cut through the witches a second time similarly simply to the first.
