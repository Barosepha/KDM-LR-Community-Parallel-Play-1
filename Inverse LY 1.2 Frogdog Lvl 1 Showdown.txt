||LY 1 Frogdog Lvl 1 Showdown||


Arrival: Blueborn is wielding the stinky Long Club, giving them 1 stink token.

Survivor starting positions: beegoo [8,8], Blueborn [12,7], Shoeborn [14,7], Doug [12,11]


Round 1 [Blueborn MC]:

AI Draw: Soaring Bony Punch [Blueborn, +1 MC insanity] 

Geeze, man...

Frogdog Leaps to [11,13] N Facing, hitting Doug for 2 damage to a random hit location [Body] (instead of one thanks to this year's empowered Mammoth Leaves. At least it wasn't the head I guess.)

Doug Suffers a heavy body injury and is knocked down. Bluebown is grabbed and placed knocked down at [10,16] and suffers 1 damage to a random hit location [Arms]. At least it wasn't beegoo, I guess.

Attack rolls: 4, 3, 1 (0 hits)

Thank goodness, this was plenty bad already before even considering any number of 2 damage hits from this. Dreading when this card shuffles back in.

Survivors' Turn:

Doug and Blueborn are knocked down and we have 0 survival on the table, so nobody's getting encouraged.

beegoo acts

Movement to [10,12]

Activate Grappleclaw

Attack rolls (3 speed as beegoo has 1 point herself): 8, 9, 4 (2 hits, Festering Maw and Posterior)


Festering Maw wound attempt: 7 (3 base roll, 3 weapon str, 1 native str. failure)

beegoo gains 1 stink token

Frogdog Leaps to [13,5] S facing, causing Shoeborn to suffer 2 damage to a random hit location [Legs] and performs Gaseous Bloat

Shoeborn is knocked down due to a heavy Leg injury

Act ends

At the end of our first Survivors' turn, exactly 1 survivor got to act and the other 3 are knocked down. We're off to the races.


Round 2 [Shoeborn MC]:

Double Sphincter: Blooming Emission. Shoeborn suffers 1 damage to the Body, gains a stink token, and suffers Flee, knocking them back nowhere because the closest board edge is through the Frogdog, and gains 2 insanity.

Activate Long Club

Attack Rolls: 5, 5 (2 hits, Sticky Tongue, Twitching Hand)

Sticky Tongue wound attempt: 13 (wound)

Twitching Hand wound attempt: Natural 1. We'll go ahead and burn a Lifetime Reroll on this since we're in a pretty precarious position if things flip on this roll: Lantern 10! (critical wound)

All survivors gain 1 insanity, and we gain 1 random Frogdog resource [Waxy Dermis]

Nice.

Act ends

Shoeborn Acts

Movement to [11,7] (The Heinous Origin right now)

Activate Founding Stone to Archive and throw it (1 automatic hit and Critical Wound)

Twitching Leg Extensors Critical Wound: Doug gains 1 accuracy token and 1 Frogdog resource [Aqueous Eye] causing beegoo to gain Eproctophilia. Mildly annoying, but not the end of the world.

This also knocks the fart off of Double Sphincter

Act ends

Doug acts

Movement to [12, 13]

Act ends


Round 3 [Doug MC]:

:^)

Act ends

Productive one, gang, good work.


Round 4 [beegoo MC]:

AI Draw: Slurp [Shoeborn or beegoo, I select Shoeborn because she has Tough]

This card is fucked.

Frogdog moves to [13, 8] S facing

Attack rolls: 1, 2, 10 (1 hit [Head])

Wish I had ANY survival to dodge! Alas, we can only wish to be so fortunate.

2 damage to the head incurs a random Head severe injury. Shoeborn does have Tough, which might help:

Head Severe Injury: 2! Made 3 by Tough. No reason not to use the lifetime reroll of a survivor who will die regardless: 5, made 6 by Tough! Deaf, -1 Evasion and 1 bleed token.

She now gets the pleasure of ALSO suffering an Arm severe injury because this card is genuinely wild.

Arms Severe Injury: 2, turned into a 3 by Tough. Saved her life on this one: Bleeding, just 2 more bleeding tokens instead of instant death. Thank you Tough.

She is also Knocked down from the Head Heavy Injury she took, but she remains alive with 3 Bleed. I'll take it.

Turn ends, Blueborn and Doug stand

Survivors' Turn:

Doug acts

Activate Mammoth Leaf to leap to [12, 10] and activate F&T from the blind spot with +4 Strength

Attack rolls: 10, 8 (2 hits, 1 perfect, Double Blinking Eye and Festering Sinuses)

Double Blinking Eye wound attempt: 8 (Thanks empowered Mammoth Leaf! That's just barely a wound)

Festering Sinuses wound attempt: 11 (wound)

Act ends

Blueborn acts

Mammoth Leaf, leap to [14, 10] and activate Long Club

Act ends

Movement to [12,6]

Activate Grappleclaw to attack

Attack rolls: 10, 4, 2 (1 perfect hit)

Festering Dome (yikes) Wound Attempt: 10 (Wound, but this reaction's scary)

Frogdog Leaps to [6, 8] (thank goodness it was that leaf and not the southern one) W facing

Gaseous Bloat

Act ends


Round 5 [Blueborn MC]:

Double Sphincter: Rotten Emission [beegoo or Doug. I'll go with beegoo since they're less likely to eat a Severe from this]

1 damage to a random hit location [Arms] (Damn.) 1 brain damage and 1 stink token, giving them the insanity they lost back thanks to Eproctophilia

Arm Severe Injury: 8. Spiral Fracture, -2 str tokens, 1 bleed, Skip Next Hunt. Nbd, lucky.

AI Draw: Wet Slap [beegoo] (same calculus as the Fart choice above. Thank goodness this isn't one of the scarier cards that were in the discard when this shuffled over. This is the Frogdog's final AI card, we're close.)

Frogdog moves to [11, 10] S facing

Attack rolls: 3, 7, 7 (2 hits, Waist x2)

Safe.

Gaseous Bloat

Turn ends, Shoeborn stands

Survivors' Turn

beegoo acts

Mammoth Leaf to leap to [11, 12] (Heinous Origin) and activate Grappleclaw (even with the -2 str tokens we're still wounding on a natural 2 thanks to our various other modifiers in play here)

Attack rolls: 6, 9, 5 (2 hits, thanks to the blind spot.)

The second card is the Trap! I was anticipating this, honestly, which is why I put beegoo in further danger instead of anyone else.

beegoo and Doug both suffer 1 brain damage and then the Frogdog performs its Basic Action on beegoo.

Frogdog faces N

Attack rolls: 9, 3, 4 (1 hit [Head])

Head heavy injury knocks down beegoo

Gaseous Bloat (2 cards on the stack now)

The HL deck is reshuffled

Frogdog has no ai cards remaining.

Blueborn acts

Movement to [14, 6]

Activate Long Club

Attack rolls: 5, 6 (2 hits, Festering Shoulder, Double Blinking Eye)

Festering Shoulder wound attempt: 6 (failure)

Double Blinking Eye wound attempt: 7 (failure)

Act ends

We're at a bit of an impasse. We have Doug who can act and attempt to wound with a Founding Stone (64% chance to get at least 1 hit, 16 of which is a 2 hit reality, and wounding with 7 on the die, 40% per hit location assuming no negative attack ending reactions. We're looking at about 1/4 odds of finishing the fight with that attack before considering the hit location deck. Founding stone does it 'guaranteed' so long as we don't whiff the stone on a critless location like the Trap. Waiting until our next turn will also almost certainly see us through, but there's a good bit of damage on the table that could pretty easily kill one or two survivors if things break bad. I think I'll greed the founding stone for once we have the Frogdoggles and take the risk on this turn. It's not too bad and worst case we get some bonus resources this year, in a way.)

Round 6 [Shoeborn MC]

Double Sphincter: Sour Emission [Shoeborn]

1 Leg damage and a stink token, this is a Severe Injury.

Leg Severe Injury: 4, made 5 by Tough. Hamstrung, unfortunate and ironically turns off Tough and whatever ability they would have gotten from getting their courage up one point to 3. What can you do. She's also sitting on 4 Bleed tokens for the moment.

AI Draw: Basic Action [Blueborn]

Frogdog moves to [12, 8] S facing

Attack rolls: 2, 3, 7 (1 hit [Body])

Just a Light injury

Gaseous Bloat

Survivors' Turn:

Doug acts

Mammoth Leaf to [12, 10] and activate Founding Stone 

Attack rolls: 4, 2 (0 hits)

Act ends

Blueborn acts

Mammoth Leaf to [14, 10] and activate Long Club

Attack rolls: 7, 7 (2 hits, Festering Exposed Gums and Twitching Achilles Tendon)

Twitching Achilles Tendon wound attempt: Lantern 10! (Critical wound)

Frogdog gains a -1 toughness token, provides us one more random Frogdog resource [Spindly Paw], and dies.

2 lantern 10 critical wounds from Blueborn this fight. The unfavored child succeeds while the chosen one is left Hamstrung.

Everyone gains 1 Hunt XP, bringing beegoo and Doug up to Age 1.

beegoo selects Whip as her weapon proficiency of choice, gains 1 point in it, and gains the Mighty Strike FA (Fighting Art)

Doug selects Fist & Tooth as his proficiency, gains 1 point in it, and rolls a 19 on Age 1 to gain 1 permanent accuracy. A promising candidate.

Additionally, we add Lingering Cough to the Timeline for this coming year, and gain 4 Basic and Frogdog resources

Our total resource rewards are as follows:

Ironclad Spine (sick, I've wanted to play with the Spiked Shield)
Supple Nose
Spindly Paw x2
Waxy Dermis
Mossy Molar
Aqueous Eye
Monster Hide
Monster Organ
Monster Bone
Broken Lantern

Our Hide situation is still pretty dire, but this is an exciting and pretty adequate haul nonetheless.
