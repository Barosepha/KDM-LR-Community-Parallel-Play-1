||LY 2 Screaming Antelope Lvl 1 Hunt||

Quick point of order before we depart, we're essentially guaranteed to hit Hooded Knight this year upon our return to the settlement, so I'm benching Doug for this hunt to avoid getting him afflicted with the Twilight Sword. Instead of him, we'll be taking a fresh survivor I've given the name Newbody.

Our hunting party is comprised of Newbody, Bluebody, Lawrence, and Steeple.


Steeple takes the first Antelope hunt event: Migration. The Screaming Antelope runs past Overwhelming Darkness. Good thing we got Song of the Brave this year!

Lawrence rolls a random Basic Hunt Event: 33, It Whispers Your Name. She is not insane, so she just gains +1 Understanding. Great.

Blueborn reveals Carpet of Ticks. Our roll totals are as follows (including Hunt XP modification):

Steeple: 4 (survival goes to zero, roll another 1d10 > 1, no consequence.)

Lawrence: 10

Blueborn: 5 (survival already at 0, second roll is a 10 so she loses 1 permanent strength. Annoying.

Newbody: 7


Newbody rolls a random Basic Hunt Event: 78, a Dead Great Game Hunter. We have a whip, so we get +4 to the roll. Newbody will go for it and gain 1 Courage: 8 total, we gain 1 random basic resource [Love Juice]. Sure thing.

Steeple rolls another Basic Hunt Event: 83, a Flesh Monolith! He gains 1 Courage and rolls a 10, netting us 2 Monster Organs. (We don't have graves, or else we'd get a bunch of survivors. Honestly I'll take the organs!)

Overwhelming Darkness! We have Song of the Brave so everyone can follow the Path of the Brave. Results as follows:

Steeple: 3, -1 accuracy token

Lawrence: 9, 1 [Arms] damage

Blueborn: 6, -1 evasion token and everyone else gains 1 survival

Newbody: 5, -1 evasion token and everyone else gains 1 survival

Awesome survival refund right before the showdown.

We arrive at the Screaming Antelope!
