||LY 10 Settlement Phase - Preparation||

Extremely little of note this year. Brief catch up, we ended up getting 2 red thread from braal and a Broken Lantern from our Scav Kit. Leer is also forced to Skip Next Hunt because of the Disembowelment they suffered in the Braal showdown. No settlement event this year because we have parallel play special rules instead, this year to do with wanderers. Unfortunately ours is rather debilitated at the moment. We just end up gaining 1 additional disposition on them, which is nice enough.

On to the settlement phase proper. Innovation time. Monster Hide, 2x ???, 1 endeavor:

Shrine, Petal Spiral, Saga, or Nightmare Training. EXTREMELY challenging pick. Second time I've been offered saga and I might not take it again. The thing is, saga doesn't do THAT much for me in all honesty. We sort of get instant tinkers from future births, but we don't have any of those lined up anyway. I think it's got to be nightmare training because that can get us to F&T, Shield, and Katar mastery very realistically.

We take Nightmare Training, but unfortunately our survivors that would like to use it are extremely spent in terms of Survival so using it for them is risky, but anyone that uses it this year thanks to Braal's special rules, I guess. Technically we didn't have it when we hit that effect in the Rewards section, I guess? But it's more fun for it to work since we got it anyway, so I'm going to treat it that way. 


Unfortunately, all but 2 survivors in our settlement die if they roll a 1, so I don't think I can really spam it as much as I'd like. We'll send those who can use it safely in, though, and then consider our options:

beegoo: 8, +1 Strength and +1 Weapon Proficiency.

Drifter: 2 > 9, +1 Strength (no weapon proficiency to speak of)

Now we have almost no options for survival generation that are particularly good, but we have Drums and A Screaming Brain.

We'll start with hitting Drums once with Leer to bring her to 5 survival and then Nightmare Training since she's so close to katar mastery.

Leer: 2 > 5 > 7, +1 strength.

Could eat the screaming brain here to continue but I'm not that desperate really. I'll use that on someone else.

While I'm thinking about it, 1 endeavor to Sanguine Extrusion, 1 red thread and an Elastic Tongue for a Red Cloak. Grid space is tight as I'm aiming to find space for Lure Lantern + dried acanthus, pickaxe, and Red Cloak + bandages.

The red cloak survivor is likely to be completely relegated to bandaging themselves almost every turn, so we may be able to fit a lot of it one one grid and forgo one of our weapons. 

We have 4 endeavors remaining and I think I may do a mass survivor cycle out for this hunting year because we have the hooded knight showing up next year. I think I'd like to offer up the Drifter as our potential twilight knight, which means we'll need to bench everyone else who isn't a fresh survivor this year and cure his arithmophilia. 3 of the remaining survivors currently have Flower addiction, which makes our choice of quarry this year extra easy. Let's see if we can sure that disorder before we commit to anything.

Drifter Barber Surgeon: 4. Arithmophilia is cured and their movement stops being 1, thank goodness.

I could drop some endeavors into the drafting table to try and grab some more seed patterns, but I think I'll just drop 3 copies of synchro strike between my weapon wielding departing survivors here (Increasing Drifter's Torment by 1)

We're off to fight a Flower Knight. Flower Addiction falls off of the 3 departing survivors that have it.
